<p><span class="smcap">He</span> sat just outside the lofty doorway, that
opened between the bare hall and front verandah.
The great white columns held a wild clematis
vine, the leaves of which almost concealed
the bricks where the plaster had fallen off. Presently
a child came out with a violin in her hand.
She went up to him, and laying her full cheek
against his shrunken one, caressed him. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
blue eyes that went black in an instant, from the
pupils’ swift dilation, had the direct gaze of one
knowing nothing of the world and never fearing
to be misunderstood. She was slim yet strong;
her waving hair that fell softly about her face was
the color of sunburnt cornsilk, her skin ovalling
from it, smooth and white, like a bursting magnolia
bud.</p>

<p>“Grandpa, I can play ‘The Mocking Bird’ for
you now.”</p>

<p>“Play it, God’s child; play it,” he said.</p>

<p>As she leaned against the column and began
playing, his face, old and worn with many griefs,
seemed, for a moment, rejuvenated by the spirit
of his lost youth. His heart stirred strangely
within him, and he was minded of another slim,
little girl, who came down to the gate to meet
him when the day was done in the long ago.
She had the same glorious hair, and tender, fearless
eyes and love for him. But that was more
than forty years gone by and she was dead.</p>

<p>As the strains became fuller and sweeter, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
bird began twittering, trilling among the leaves,
imitating the sounds it heard.</p>

<p>“Listen. Do you hear that, Esther?” whispering,
as he searched for a sight of the singer.
“There it is. It’s a mocking bird,” he said,
pointing to the young thing, as the fluting
feathers on its throat stood out like the pipes of
an organ. Its song, accompanying the tune,
never ceased until the violin was tossed upon the
bench and the child was in the old man’s arms.</p>

<p>“That was beautiful, beautiful!” His eyes were
filled with tears of enthusiasm that fell upon her
hair.</p>

<p>“Your mother used to play that, when she was
young.” He spoke with the weight of profound
emotion, that glowed in his eyes, and quivered
on his lips.</p>

<p>“And did the bird sing with her?” a softer
look coming upon the childish face.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember that it did, though she was
always a friend to the birds that built their nests
about us. She kept the boys from breaking them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
up or trapping them. Every spring they sang
here in the trees. They seemed to know that she
was looking after them. That must have been
what she was born for. She was always watching
over something or somebody.” He swallowed
hard. “I can see her now, bending over her
work, late at night, stitching away, with her fingers
on those gray clothes for the boys in the
army&#8212;your Uncle Billy and your father.”</p>

<p>“Was she little, then?” Esther inquired, while
with one hand she clasped his wrist, and with the
other stroked his brow.</p>

<p>“No. When the war broke out, she was just
about to be married to your father, who had been
appointed Captain under General Lee. She made
a coat for him and quilted money in the collar.
She had a way of doing things that nobody would
have thought of. You remind me of her.” He
folded his hands across his stick and was silent
for a moment. “There is much about her life
that I want you to know, and bear in mind, now
that you are getting old enough to understand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
She had great hopes for you, for your music.
I’ve been thinking how proud she would be if she
could know that you had got along well enough
to be invited to play at the University&#8212;on commencement
night at that. I ask nothing higher
for you than that you make such a woman as
your mother.”</p>

<p>They did not see the old negro, ragged to the
skin, coming around the corner of the house, carrying
his discolored straw hat in one hand and
mopping his face on a faded cotton handkerchief.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">G’mornin’</span>, Marse Hardin.”</p>

<p>“Howdy, Sandy. Where did you come from?
I thought you’d gone clear out of the country,
for good.”</p>

<p>“Nor sir, nor sir. You jes’ let a nigger git a
taste of dis here spring water, and he’s charmed,
conjured, he kyant stay away if he do go. But
I come back, dis time, to see my young marster&#8212;Marse
Davy Pool.”</p>

<p>“How is he to-day?”</p>

<p>“He daid. Dat’s what I was sent to tell you.
Dey guinter bury him up at de old place.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear of his death, Sandy. He
was the best one of the boys.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so, sir; ’tain’t nobody guine to miss him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
like his mammy do. She’s told me to ax you for
your hoss and buggy. She’s afeared of the boys’
hosses, dey keep such wild uns. Marse Davy
sold his’n, dat was the onliest one she would ride
behind. She said she wanted Marse Hardin
Campbell’s. It was so trusty and gentlelike.”</p>

<p>“I was going to use it after dinner.” Mr.
Campbell hesitated.</p>

<p>“Send it on, grandpa. Send it on.” Esther
saw the inquiring look her grandfather turned
upon her. “Something will turn up.”</p>

<p>“Suppose it shouldn’t; would you be disappointed?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I never count on being disappointed,” she
responded, quickly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t she some kin to Miss Mary Campbell?”
The negro’s face lighted as he asked the question.</p>

<p>“That’s her daughter, Miss Esther Powel.”</p>

<p>“It ’peared to me like I seed de favor in her
face. Ev’ybody loved your mammy, honey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
’Twarn’ nobody that didn’t,” he said, turning to
look again at Esther.</p>

<p>“The horse is in the pasture.” Mr. Campbell
turned to the child. “Can’t you run and show
him where the bridle is?” Bareheaded, she
bounded down the steps, and motioned to the old
negro to follow. She took the bridle and swung
it over his arm. “Mind the foot log. Uncle Sandy,
the hand rail has been washed away. The
pasture is over the creek. There is Selam now,
under the sweet gum tree.” She pointed. “You
will find the harness in the carriage house here.”</p>

<p>She watched him go over the slope to the
creek, then stood gazing about her in childish
contemplation. It was nearly noon. The
shadow straightening in the doorway indicated
it.</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell looked and saw her. His heart
warmed toward her comeliness; moreover she
was sweet of nature and had a ready smile even
for those who had not been kind to her. Suddenly
she disappeared in the direction of the carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
house. She feared that her pony could not pull
the heavy vehicle that alone was left to take her
to the University. It taxed her strength to draw
the heavy bar from across the carriage house
door. She sprang backward, as she dropped it
upon the ground; then went in to examine the
carriage that had not been used since she was a
baby, almost fifteen years before. The clumsy
conveyance had small iron steps that let down&#8212;steps
that her mother’s child feet had pressed in
climbing to the seat. The wheels were so heavy
and cumbersome that she shook her head doubtfully.
The green satin lining was in shreds; the
worn leather seats covered with tufts of hair,
while here and there a dead leaf or twig was
tangled in its coarse mesh. It had required a
pair to draw it in those old days. She had forgotten
that. The tongue was held up in its position
above by a girder in the loft. Esther gave
it a strong, hard pull; the tongue fell forward,
and as she skipped out of its path the lumbering
old carriage went rolling down the incline, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
clouds of dust, as though indignant at being disturbed,
sullenly rose and fell about her.</p>

<p>Old and dilapidated harness that hung down
from the walls swayed slowly in the general commotion.
Esther wiped the dust from her eyes and
drew a long breath, looking defiantly at the result.
She looked down. There, at her feet, lay
a bird, fluttering beside its fallen nest. Her face
lost its look of defiance.</p>

<p>“You poor, little thing,” bending down and
cuddling it to the softness of her cheek. “Don’t
die, please, don’t die!” she said, in dismay. “It
will break my heart if I have killed you.” With
tears streaming down her face she ran swiftly
to the house.</p>

<p>“Grandpa, do something for it,” laying it in his
hand. “Can you save it? It’s a mocking bird,
too. I shook it out of the carriage.”</p>

<p>“They have nested there for years,” he said as
he drew the wings gently through his fingers.
“They are not broken,” he assured her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Are you sure it will live?” She was looking at
him with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“Live? Yes; and have a nest and young ones
of its own next year. It is only stunned. Leave
it in the parlor where it will be safe from the
cats and it will be all right soon.”</p>

<p>A faint rumbling noise broke in upon their
voices. They looked up to listen. It was like
the sound of a wagon rolling. “Put it away,
quick, and run to the creek to show them how to
cross the ford.” They had kept close watch over
the passers since the winter hauling had cut deep
holes in the bed of the stream. It was a treacherous
crossing. Closing the door upon her charge,
Esther ran through the garden, the nearest way.
She sped with the lithe agility of a young fawn,
and before the newcomer was fairly into the
stream she was there giving directions. The
mountain stream ran fleet between its low banks,
winding in haste through the valley. Tall sycamores,
sentinels in silver armor, stood beside it
on either hand.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Campbell</span> stood watching. Very soon
the front gate opened and a boy came in, driving
two white mules, with red tassels on their bridle
bits. Amazement filled his eyes when he saw
that it was a wagon load of coffins, and on the
topmost one Esther sat smiling. As they drove
up near the door, he went out to help her down.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you something would turn up,
grandpa; this wagon is going right by the University
this evening.” She threw her arms about
his neck; her laugh rang out in pure triumph.
“Hitch your team, young man; a boy will come
to take it out and feed it.” When they saw
Esther again she was ready for her jaunt. Her
violin was in its case; her fresh white organdie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
folded with as much care as she gave to anything&#8212;duty
and care were unknown to her. Her
visit to the University by such a conveyance
would be the extreme limit of indulgence, yet
she had no thought of being denied.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” she announced at table. Mr.
Campbell burst into a laugh, half of annoyance,
yet touched with the ring of true amusement.</p>

<p>“I really believe you would go.”</p>

<p>“I’d go on foot if necessary to keep my promise,”
she answered quickly.</p>

<p>“How could the college folks know that Mr.
David Pool had to be buried to-day when they
printed my name on the programme?”</p>

<p>Watching her eyes, he caught their softness,
their innocence, and knew that her eagerness
was sincere.</p>

<p>“Let her go, Mr. Campbell, I’ll take good
care of her.” The boy was a Rudd. Although
he held a lowly position, he was not counted of
the common people. Mr. Campbell had the old
Virginia pride of race in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“I know you would.”</p>

<p>Esther looked steadily into his gray eyes and
saw a relenting twinkle.</p>

<p>“Am I going?” Turning to her with a quiet
smile: “Yes, you may go.” He could not see her
disappointed when her heart was so determined.
With a little cry of joy she brought her hands together.
“I wish you could come along, grandpa.
It will be such fun, and I wanted you to hear me
to-night.” When the wagon came around Esther
was helped up with her case and bundle. Her
violin she held tenderly across her arm. Mr.
Campbell went with them to close the gate.</p>

<p>“Good-bye; you will be in for me to-morrow.”
Leaning down, she embraced his head. “Be
sweet, God’s child,” he said, as they drove off.
Esther kissed her hand to him, as he stood by
the roadside looking after them. The cook, at
the kitchen door, waved her dish rag for a frantic
moment. The whirl of dust from the wheels
soon clouded the view. The old man turned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and went slowly back to the house with a misty
smile over his features.</p>

<p>A quaint, pathetic figure that, of Hardin
Campbell, with his age, his poverty and the care
of this child. Here had once been planter life
in its carelessness and lavishness. It had been
the home of friend and neighbor and the hospitable
shelter of the transient guest. All the
grand folk that came that way made this place
headquarters in the days when Mr. Campbell was
reckoned rich. But what he had lost in wealth
he had more than gained in pride, and the child
was brimming over with it. Generous, impetuous,
enthusiastic, as she was, this wild young
creature of nature, unhindered, venturesome and
full of whims, would, he hoped, find pride her
safeguard. He did not believe in curbing her.
He guided, but did not limit her and tried to keep
from her all warping influences. This was the
way her mother had begun with her and he was
only continuing her way for a while&#8212;it could
not be very long before he would have to resign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
his charge. To whom&#8212;he did not know and
could not bear to dwell upon the thought.</p>

<p>About the whole place there was evidence of
departed glory. In the great white buildings
which rose from the labyrinth of shrubbery like
grim ghosts of the past; in the rows of cabins,
formerly the dwellings of a horde of happy-hearted
negroes, everywhere was evidence of the
bygone prodigal days. The house, of colonial
style, with its series of tall columns standing
about the broad colonnade, was partially screened
by the live oaks and was set some distance back
from the big road. These encircling columns
were built of brick, with a coating of plaster,
once as white as the teeth of Uncle Simon, the
plantation white-washer, who in former days
would put an immaculate dress on them regularly
once a month by means of an elevated step-ladder,
but now Uncle Simon’s labors were done.
The neglected columns were crumbling with age
and sadly splotched with the red of exposed
masonry. At one side of the verandah there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
spread the delicate green of the star-jassamine,
with its miniature constellations flecking the
background. Through the vista, leading to the
house, from the big gate in front, flashed the
crimson of a flowering-pear in full blossom. The
blinds of the house that had once been green,
were now hanging from their hinges, weather-stained,
giving full view of a number of broken
window panes, in one of which, on the second
story, was perched a wren, whose energetic chattering
over her nest hardby was the most decided
indication of active life.</p>

<p>In the rear of the buildings stretched the
cabins. To the right of them were the stables
and the carriage house, with its weather vane of
a flying steed on the top, but for years the most
vigorous gales had failed to spur this steed to
action and its tail, at one time proudly aflaunt
to the breeze, had yielded to time and rust, and,
like that of Tam o’Shanter’s mare, knew naught
of direction. There was the dreary stillness of
desolation over all things. But still a hospitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
glow was in the summer sunshine and shone as
well in the eyes of the old master.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Esther took off her hat when she got into the
depths of the woods and drew out her violin. “I
will amuse the boy,” she thought, “if I play to
him,” for she had tired of talking against the
rumbling of the wagon and its load. In his way,
he appreciated her motive, for now and again he
called back to her, awkwardly commending her,
and urging her to continue. Near the spring
they saw the negro washerwomen, with sleeves
rolled to their shining shoulders, bending over
their tubs; faded, limp skirts, bloused through
apron belts, and dangled about their bare legs.
A big wash kettle heaped with white linen stood
to one side. Around it a fire was burning low
for want of fuel.</p>

<p>“O&#8212;o&#8212;h! Yo’ Tagger, Tag-g-e-r; you’d better
come on here, ef you know what’s good for
you,” called one of the women with a long, resounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
echo that drowned the answer of the
small voice that said he was on his way. A troop
of little niggers came to the roadside pulling a
wagon load of brush and bark gathered through
the woods. They looked back and spied Esther
on the coffins. With a wild yell the children,
load and all, tumbled over the embankment,
rolling over each other in the dust, screaming,
“Mammy! mammy!” at the top of their voices,
scrambling to their feet and running with might
and main down the road. As Esther drew up to
the wash-place, the little fellows were clinging
frantically to the knees of their mothers.</p>

<p>“It’s a little ha’nt blowin’ Gabel’s trumpet.
Don’t let it ketch me! don’t let it ketch me!”</p>

<p>“In de name ob de Lawd!” said one of the
women, seeing what had caused the fright; “ain’t
you all got de sense you was born wid? Don’t
you know Miss Esther Powel, Marse Hardin’s
granddaughter?” The eyes of the pickaninnies
were blinded by the wads of wet aprons they had
covered them with, and the sound of the wheels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
filled them with terror. “Dry up!” The big
dripping hand pounded on their heads. “Scuse
’em, Miss Esther, you’d think dese youngun’s
been fotch up wid wild injun’s.”</p>

<p>“Tagger,” Esther called the boy, whose name,
Montague, she had been responsible for. “Don’t
you know me? I played for you to dance a jig
for the young men who used to visit Will Curtis
before he died. You haven’t forgotten that, have
you?” Hearing her familiar voice, he slowly
peeped out with scared eyes.</p>

<p>“You little monkey. Dip me some water
out of the spring.” She saw a long, yellow
gourd hanging from a striped bough above their
heads. “I want a drink.” He sprang up and
snatched the gourd, and before she could say
more, he was holding it up to her, standing on
his tiptoes, grinning, as the tears ran down and
stained his dusty face.</p>

<p>“I am going to play at the University to-night,”
she said, hanging back the gourd.</p>

<p>“You don’ say? One of dem ’Varsity gemmen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
coming out to see Marse Will’s folks next
week.” Tagger’s mother lived with the Curtises,
whose home was just beyond the spring. “I’ll be
bound, you beat ’em all dar if you does play
to-night,” she said when she saw they were leaving.</p>

<p>Bareheaded, Esther rode on, as long as the
shade was over them, tying on her hat only when
they got to the sunny way of the road. A man
plowing in a cornfield, looked up as he stopped
at the turn of the row. He gazed intently, rapping
the line mechanically about his wrist.</p>

<p>“What is her grandpa thinking of?” seeing it
was Esther, whom he knew. “But she’d a gone
in spite of hell and high water.” With this aloud
to himself, he drew his shirt sleeve across the
sweat on his brow and trudged back down the
row, relieved.</p>

<p>After two hours or more, through the heat,
Esther was glad when at last she could see the
end of her journey. The sunlight lay radiant upon
the stretch of country famed for this honored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
institution of learning. Just before her, upon an
eminence, spread the University buildings, the
tall spires marking their profile on the sky. The
sun’s rays shot up behind them its last warm
flashes. Its heat had already dampened Esther’s
hair, deepening the red tint of its waves against
her temples. The campus was alive with students
coming and going in every direction. The
tenor of the glee club, in his striped sweater of
the college colors, humming a popular air,
walked leisurely across to where one fellow was
sprawled on the ground, gazing at the wagon
with an amused curiosity on his handsome face.</p>

<p>“By Jupiter! that’s a pretty child.” The tenor
turned to look, as his friend spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t a caper! Wonder where she
is bound?” Just then a pert freshman, standing
in a group, gave a college yell. Then there was
a chorus of rapturous cheers, in which most of
them joined. Before the noise had subsided, the
man on the grass had leaped to his feet, full of indignation,
and dashed off toward the freshman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“Silence! you fellows! Have you forgotten
yourselves?” A few hisses were mingled with
the applause that greeted him, but the freshman
was quick to say at his elbow:</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean it for her.”</p>

<p>“How could she know that?” He walked away
saying: “I’ll wager there is something out of
the ordinary in that girl.”</p>

<p>He was of the fiber that commanded the respect
of men at a glance.</p>

<p>“Andrews always turns up at the right time,
you may count on that,” said one of the students
as he watched him sauntering in the direction of
the wagon, his eyes following the child. She was
perched like a white winged bird of good omen
on a funeral pyre. Only a nature adventurous to
audacity would do such a thing as that. But he
loved daring personalities, strong motives and
even a misadventure, if it were a brave one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glenn Andrews</span> was, by every gift of nature,
a man. His sensitive, expressive face, his
brown eyes glowing with a light that seemed to
come from within, his clear and resolute bearing,
all gave evidence of his sterling qualities. All
through his college years he was known among
his fellows as a dreamer. His was one of those
aloof&#8212;almost morbidly solitary natures, to
whom contact with the world would seem jarring
and out of key. The boys had nicknamed him
“Solitaire.” He had a womanly delicacy in morals,
his sense of honor was as clean and bright as
a soldier’s sword.</p>

<p>Those who knew him well loved him, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
of his school fellows sought for his notice, the
more, perhaps, because he gave it rarely.</p>

<p>Whenever he played with them, it was as one
who unconsciously granted a favor. He was
looked upon as a man who would be a sharer in
the talents of his race. This was his ambition.
He had strong literary tastes and was a serious
worker.</p>

<p>Often he champed at the bit through the slow
routine of college life&#8212;the genius within him
thirsting for action like a spirited horse, just in
sound of the chase.</p>

<p>After the exercises that night, the pretty faces
and scent of roses filled the chapel with light and
fragrance. Everything was in warm confusion,
congratulations blended with tender farewells
and honest promises that youth was sure to
break.</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews, with the dignity that went
well with his cap and gown, was making his
way out. The tenor touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“What did you think of that violin solo?”</p>

<p>“Fine, my boy, fine! She played just before
my turn, and she must have been my inspiration,
for I was surprised to get the medal.”</p>

<p>“I’m jolly glad you got it anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Did you find out who she was?”</p>

<p>“Esther Powel. Her grandfather is a friend of
Professor Stark. He did it to give her a chance.”</p>

<p>“Well she used it for all it was worth,” said
Andrews.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Esther</span> was standing by the rim of a clear
pool in the woods, gazing down into the water.
Her big hat was weighted with cockle blooms
that she had gathered in coming through the
wheat. In this natural mirror she could see that
a stem here was too long, another there was
turned the wrong way to look well. With both
hands to her head she was intent upon regulating
the effect to please her eye. Turning her head
first to one side, then another, she smiled at herself,
impulsive, always in motion, quick as a
wren. The water was so clear that one could see
the last year’s leaves lying at its depths. It was
deep and sloped toward the center. Inverted it
would look like a mound where children are told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
that Indians are buried, when the one can think
of no other excuse for its grave-like appearance.
This pool went by the name of “Indian Well.”
Esther had no thought but that she was alone,
until she saw an image, a serious young face, reflected
there, with soft, brown beard and hair,
and deep eyes that wore a languid, meditating
look. He stooped and dipped his curved hand
into the surface and was raising it to his lips.
Suddenly, instinctively, she bounded to his side,
dashing the water from his hands before he could
drink.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know there is fever in it?”</p>

<p>For a moment he looked at her in wonder.</p>

<p>“The fever,” he repeated, “what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“The germs of typhoid&#8212;I thought everybody
knew that.”</p>

<p>“But you see I am not everybody,” he answered,
laughing.</p>

<p>She looked at every feature of his face. “But
didn’t you feel like it the other night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>This surprised him so that he had not made
an answer when she went on: “Everybody who
has died of typhoid fever around here drank
water out of ‘Indian Well.’ This is where they
got the germ.”</p>

<p>“I was never here before. You are very good
to warn me.” He looked at her and she seemed
so sweet and beautiful as she stood there, between
him and danger. Whether real or imagined,
her motive was the same.</p>

<p>“Is your home near by?”</p>

<p>“I live with my grandpa in the white house on
the road as you came up.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come by the road; I came through
by the wood-path from the Curtises. I’m spending
the summer there. What a pity this lovely
spot is poisoned, I am sorry; I might see you
here again but for that. It makes a pretty tryst,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Sorry? Why? You don’t know me.”</p>

<p>This pleased him. He had found a refreshing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
creature. At the outset he had thrilled at the
prospect.</p>

<p>“Don’t I? You played once where I had the
pleasure of hearing you. Your name is Esther&#8212;Esther
Powel.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I have seen your face before I saw
it in the water. They called you ‘Glenn Andrews’
when they gave you the medal.”</p>

<p>She slowly looked him over from head to
foot, and smiled as if in a trance of joy. It was
all so wonderful, so strange&#8212;this hero’s coming.</p>

<p>“But I am still ahead. You will never see me
win laurels again, perhaps, and I expect to hear
you play many times.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be sure. It’s no use for me to play.
People don’t seem to care whether they hear it
or not. I play for myself, because the sounds
from my violin seem to express what I feel.”</p>

<p>“But suppose I care?”</p>

<p>“Then I will play for you sometime, if we
should meet again.”</p>

<p>“When could I get in your way?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Most any time.”</p>

<p>“Will you be home all summer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and winter, too.” She laughed at his
question.</p>

<p>“Let us sit down and rest a while together. I
want to talk over the pleasure that is in store for
me.”</p>

<p>Little did he think as she agreed, and they sat
down on an old log, how much in later life and
amidst different scenes, he was to lament that circumstance.
“I have always loved the country.
It is so true, so beautiful; I love it from the bottom
of my heart.”</p>

<p>He lifted his face, drawing a deep breath; the
air was clean and sweet with the scent of growing
things.</p>

<p>“Everything is beautiful that’s natural,” she
said, touching the beflowered hat. “I never even
wear ‘bought’ flowers, because they are only
make-believes. I hate anything that is not sure-enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a pretty idea. I wondered where you
found this.”</p>

<p>“Just made it.”</p>

<p>She seemed to have grasped a good deal for
her years.</p>

<p>“I see you have learned a way of your own
in your travels.”</p>

<p>“Travels! I’ve never been out of this valley,
but I have grandpa and my mother and my
dreams.”</p>

<p>“Your mother. I heard that your mother was
dead,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p>“She isn’t as long as I am living,” was her
answer.</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews looked at her. There was wisdom
in the sentiment she expressed. All the
childishness had passed out of her face.</p>

<p>He hesitated, astonished. “I believe that, in a
sense,” he said. “It is my theory of fulfillment.
What could spur us to higher destinies than the
belief that we were carrying out the hopes, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
aims of someone we loved&#8212;perpetuating their
life through our own!”</p>

<p>“She wanted me to be a musician,” Esther began
with a sudden dimness in her eyes. “She
was one until she had rheumatism in her arms.
I’ve strength and health to build on, something
she lacked. My mother was an invalid all her
life after I was born.”</p>

<p>“Health is the most priceless gift in this
world.”</p>

<p>For a time he forgot it was near the dinner
hour. He was caught by the witchery of the girl
and the place.</p>

<p>He had expected to find nothing here but solitude
and shade. The adventure had been a delightful
surprise to him.</p>

<p>As they got up from the log: “I shall expect
you to keep your promise about the music. Are
you going my way?”</p>

<p>“No; mine is the opposite direction. I will
play for you any time because you want to hear
me. Good-bye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Glenn Andrews looked after her, as she went
her way. Here was a study&#8212;a promise. All his
life he had loved growth. Anything in the course
of development delighted and inspired him. He
struck off up the path that wound out of the
woods into the field.</p>

<p>The scent of high summer was in the gold of
the wheat. Running his hands lightly over the
bearded sheaves he whistled an air that was to
recall neither the genius that wrote it nor the
hopes of his own work, but the face of Esther
Powel and the friendship thus begun, of which
he would never think lightly afterward.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Curtis home had an ample territory over
which extended eight large rooms and as many
half stories with dormer windows. The big mock
oranges locked antlers across the path that led
from the gate to the little square porch where
the wood bees droned in and out of the nests they
had bored in the wooden posts.</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis was a jovial man, round of face,
short of stature, and given to hospitality. He
had been all his days faithful to that laborious
outdoor occupation&#8212;farming. In his old age
the prosperous impression that everything made
proved that he had filled his place to some account.</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews, who had been his son’s comrade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
in life, was an honored guest. His vacation,
usually spent in travel, had been claimed by the
lonely parents this time. He was promised all
manner of recreations and indulgences. They
hoped to send him back as hardy as an Indian,
his white face and hands bronzed as the leaves
in their turning. Broad hours and solitude. How
welcome they were to him! His place was sacred
in this house, and no one was allowed to disturb
or criticise him. He had set apart a few hours
each day for work. He could not devote all his
vacation to rest and pleasure. It was not his nature.
A memory of his strange, lonely boyhood
came to him with vivid distinctness, and the absolute
despair, he suffered at the possibility of
never being able to achieve greatness in the
world. He wanted to see good results in his life.
The whole intensity of his spirit was bent on that
one purpose. The world he would know, and the
men that live in it. His mind was full of daring
conceptions and ideals.</p>

<p>A wild grace permeated his personality, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
strong and delightful charm which was to make
him a conqueror.</p>

<p>That morning Glenn ate breakfast with the
family by lamplight. He went back to his window
afterwards and watched the sun rise. At
this season of the year the beauty of Virginia
was at its height. He delighted from the first
in the splendid scenery and moody weather.</p>

<p>A haze of purple mist was lifting slowly from
the mountains between whose heart the valleys
lay. The view was fresh with the lusty color of
midsummer. Exquisite perfumes, breath of
young corn and cut clover, came to him and grew
sharper and sweeter as the dawn opened wide.
In nature he could see the warm heart of life,
tender, strong and true. In the distance stretched
the wheat fields studded over with yellow shocks,
waiting for harvest-time. Later, as Glenn Andrews
passed out on his way to the woods, he
saw the lengthening of the table, the unusual hurry
among the servants, which was a sign that he
was to have dinner that day in a harvest home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Wheat threshing time was on. This lover of the
sun, of long, wandering strolls, took the way he
had not been. It did not concern him much
which way he took to solitude. Wherever they
met they made friends&#8212;he and solitude. They
were so much alike. Their sympathies were so
much akin. Both were full of deep nature, dignity
and intense self-possession; they could not
but find comforting good-fellowship. With solitude
he could almost hear the voice of God, hear it
speaking, between him and his hopes. Returning,
he stopped at “Indian Well.” A long time he sat
there, face to face with his own heart and brain.
He made notes at times in a small book, which
he kept always with him. The class poet and
editor of the college magazine had a right to drop
into rhyme whenever he felt like it, even though
the indulgence might never be known to the
world. Glenn Andrews took out his second cigar,
drew a whiff of its scent and put it back in his
pocket. In his self-denial there was the compensation
of looking forward. He smoked it that afternoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
over his work. The sun was striking aslant
and was not far from setting. Here was a broad
hint to hurry if he cared to see them harvesting.
The engine sent its shrill whistling call for “wheat”
as he leaned over the fence. Dressed in a hunting
suit of brown tweed with tan boots laced
from the ankle to the knee, his broad hat pulled
forward to shade his eyes, Glenn Andrews attracted
notice. The field was alive with toilers
moving easily, swiftly, leaning in a hundred
graceful inclinations; some were loading their
wagons, lifting and loosening their shocks with
a thrust of their pitch-forks, others unloading
them beside the thresher, clipping the twine that
bound the bundles and making a moving bridge
of beaten gold as they fed it. The heated engineer,
with his oil-can, stood at the head of the
monstrous steam horse that had never lost its
mysterious power to charm the negro.</p>

<p>Tagger often stopped to stare and wonder.
The machinery belt, smooth and glittering like
a broad satin ribbon, industriously turning on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
great wheels, made him dance, barefooted over
the stubble, to the music of its motion. Little
imps, such as he, counted this day of the year a
holiday high above all others they had ever
known.</p>

<p>The mule that was driven with a long lasso under
the straw as it fell had a half-dozen or more
children to pull every time it went to the stack.
In spite of the dust and the chaff that covered
their heads and half stifled them, they gave a wild
dart and leaped upon the heap as it was hauled
away. Sometimes the wind took a whirl and
scattered the straw, niggers and all broadcast
along the field. Glenn Andrews’ heart beat
lightly, the air thrilled with sounds, the music
of the harvesters and the hum of the thresher.
There is nothing like life under the open heaven,
he knew. Glenn was a gypsy by nature.</p>

<p>“How is it turning out?” he asked, coming up
to Mr. Curtis, who was counting the loaded
wagons that were filled with sacks of wheat, starting
off to be stored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Very good; the yield is something like sixteen
bushels to the acre. I’ll have about eighteen
hundred altogether.” Glenn Andrews looked up
and saw a figure coming across the stubble&#8212;one
that stood out in delicate relief, slimmer,
shapelier than the rest. She was all in white;
Mr. Curtis saw her, too.</p>

<p>“Here comes the fly-up-the-creek,” he said.
“She looks like a hearse horse with all those
elder blooms on her head.” His speech had no
touch of spitefulness.</p>

<p>“I like her way; she is as wild and lawless as
the wind, and as free.” Glenn Andrews never
thought or spoke of Esther without defense.</p>

<p>“Yes, and as sprightly as they make ’em,”
Mr. Curtis began. “She never went to school a
day in her life. Her mother taught her, and
her grandpa reads to her. But play the fiddle&#8212;she
can play it to beat the band. She just
took it up first. She could catch any tune.
A teacher came along about two years ago
who knew a little about the fiddle. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Campbell is very poor now. He let the lady
board with him to give Esther lessons while she
was teaching in the district. She would not practice,
they say, but you never saw anybody learn
like she did without it.”</p>

<p>“What a pity she hasn’t a chance to keep on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she never will. The old man is failing;
I don’t know what’s to become of her when
he’s gone. He worries over not being able to
give her a musical education. You’d never think
it, he is so quiet about it.”</p>

<p>“Has she no near relatives who would take her
and help her to get a start?”</p>

<p>“Only one, a nephew of the old man, but he
married a plain, common woman. His marriage
was a shock to the family. If his was made
in heaven, as some folks believe in, I say the Lord
had a grudge against him. He started out with
fine prospects, but he’s had a lot of trouble. It
looks like some folks can’t have anything but
trouble and children. He has a family of six.
He ain’t more than thirty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Glenn took a deep breath.</p>

<p>“With such a weight as that it is no wonder he
is sore. I wish the child did have some way to
escape such a future. With a talent like hers she
could rise above the minor cares. The world already
has enough ill-paid drudges.”</p>

<p>With this he left Mr. Curtis to meet Esther.</p>

<p>“Can you show us anything prettier than this
in your cities?” she asked. Looking about her
she thought it made the hardiest, happiest scene
in the world.</p>

<p>“No, I could only show you something different&#8212;new;
to the average mind it is unaccustomedness
that charms. I like this because it
is new.” The world he had known seemed immeasurably
far off to them as they stood together
there. Everything about her touched him. Her
true, simple nature, her strong, pure devotion to
her own ideals.</p>

<p>“You haven’t played for me yet.”</p>

<p>As he heard the engine blowing off the steam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
he knew they were rounding up; its work was
done.</p>

<p>“No, and you didn’t want to hear me as much
as you made out; you forgot,” she said.</p>

<p>“I would like to hear you this minute.”</p>

<p>“Then come with me home.”</p>

<p>“But look at me: my face&#8212;my hands&#8212;these
boots.”</p>

<p>Esther looked at him quickly. “You are vain.”
Slipping her hand in his, she gently pulled him a
little way. “Oh, come on, what do you suppose
I care about dust. We have soap and water.”</p>

<p>He let her have her way, and allowed himself
to be led.</p>

<p>The sun hung low in the sky as they started
off, and was just dropping behind the mountains
when they reached the house. Faint zones of
pink and pearl flushed up, and everything was
quickened&#8212;glorified by the softening light.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a picture in my scrap book that looks
like you.” Esther stared Glenn Andrews full in
the face as she spoke. “It is a picture of Christ.”</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I like</span> you in those high boots.” Esther put
her foot on the tip of one of them as she spoke.</p>

<p>“It was not so much vanity, as respect for your
grandfather, that made me want to appear at my
best when I met him.”</p>

<p>“You see, he didn’t notice them. Why should
you care, anyhow, if I liked them.”</p>

<p>There was a certain charm in her contempt for
risks and consequences. A waiter was brought
out clinking with glasses.</p>

<p>“This will not only prove your welcome, Mr.
Andrews, but aid your digestion as well,” Mr.
Campbell said, as he came out of the hall to join
them.</p>

<p>Andrews filled his glass that yielded fragrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and soft fire. He touched it to his lips.
“This is excellent. Is it some of your own
make?”</p>

<p>“The grapes came from my vineyard.”</p>

<p>“I helped to make it&#8212;I strained it,” Esther
interrupted, “but I never tasted any in my life.”
Mr. Campbell laid his hand on her head.</p>

<p>“This is to you&#8212;to your art.” Glenn Andrews
motioned to her, lifted his glass and sipped
the wine, slowly realizing it was beautiful to
every sense. Esther stole into the parlor, and
was playing her violin before they knew it. They
followed her in. It was an old-time parlor with
black, carved furniture, a slender legged center
table, polished as smooth as a mirror, holding a
china vase of curious design, in which leaned
one long stemmed rose, as red as the wine that
had made their hearts large and soft. The walls
were almost hidden by family portraits that
reached from the ceiling to the floor, set in deep
tarnished gilt frames. The carpet had a shred of
tracery suggesting a design&#8212;it might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
only a shadow of gorgeous wreaths that had
been worn away by dear feet that had long gone&#8212;the
whole faint impression still hallowed by
their tread.</p>

<p>Esther loved her violin irregularly. This was a
time when she really needed it. They went in
very quietly, hoping not to interrupt her. The
soft, tremulous tones that she had not meant to
give, showed that she was excited, unnerved.
Just as Glenn was about to utter an apology for
the confusion, his face became serious and silent.
He was peculiarly sensitive to the influence of
the violin. He was conscious of a dreamy exaltation,
and the awakening of a new enthusiasm.
The music had burst into a wild, passionate tenderness,
as though she was daringly investing all
her dreams with life-throbbing human life&#8212;the
tone fairly voicing the longing of her soul.</p>

<p>It was infinitely touching, infinitely tender. A
quick flush went up to his forehead and died out
again, as the music trembled into stillness, and
she lowered the violin, exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“You must be very proud of her,” Glenn
turned to the old man, “I think she has a future.”</p>

<p>“She ought to have a chance for it,” said Mr.
Campbell. A glance from Esther’s flushed face
to the suddenly compressed lips of her grandfather
made Glenn understand that that was as
near to complaint as he ever came. He might
have been impatient in his days of strength, but
on the coming of adversity this proud man had
learned to wait in silence. He seldom breathed a
syllable of the sorrow he bore on account of his
hands being tied.</p>

<p>“Practice is half the battle; you ought to
spend hours at it every day,” Glenn said to Esther
as she tossed her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t ever expect to study under anyone
again. What’s the use going half way when I
know I can never go the other half?”</p>

<p>“But you will if you only have belief in yourself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell was delighted as he listened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Here was someone interested in his little girl.
He trusted a kindliness so genuine, an interest
so evidently sincere.</p>

<p>A child’s soul is easily impressed, responsive
to the first panorama that passes before it. Mr.
Campbell hoped Glenn Andrews would come
again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next few weeks for Esther were transitions
between content and longing. The trees of
the woodland, that had been her playfellow, now
had a rival. Of Glenn Andrews she had made a
hero, a king. She regarded him as a being to
inspire wonder and mystery.</p>

<p>His simplest word or gesture spoke directly to
the heart.</p>

<p>They took sweet wood rambles together. He
had already begun to realize that all solitary
pleasures were selfish.</p>

<p>He rather looked forward to their meetings,
although he did not let her think they meant
much to him.</p>

<p>“When do you want to see me again?” was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
usually his parting question. If she said “to-morrow,”
he could not come until the next day,
or later. To her it seemed that he took a pride
in finding out when she most wanted to see him&#8212;only
to stay away at that particular time. He
held himself aloof&#8212;gave her room to expand.
Hers was a nature artistic to a painful degree&#8212;a
nature nobly expansive.</p>

<p>But within the limit of the country, amid entirely
commonplace people, her power of artistic
perception had been of little value&#8212;rather a burden
than a delight.</p>

<p>One day, after she had urged Glenn Andrews
to go with her to where they would have a pretty
view of a mountain waterfall, he had refused, and
she had gone alone. It was a long stroll, but she
was thirsting to see it. She resented his refusal,
and so had gone alone. Glenn watched her out
of sight, then went back to his writing. He was
doing some of his strongest and most vigorous
work.</p>

<p>Esther reached the mountain side, and stood a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
little way back to keep the spray from wetting
her dress. The breath of it was refreshing. She
took a pride in the mighty roar of the falls.</p>

<p>Its voice sounded so strong, so real. Its commanding
majesty held her. She repeated a name,
its echo was drowned. Flowers, ferns, great
rocks, everything in its track was treated to the
same reckless inconsideration. Only the mist
rose higher and higher as though it would regain
the height it lost when the waters made the
mighty leap, and dashed its very heart to pieces
on the stones below.</p>

<p>How she gloried in the daring of the mist. It
was so light, and thin, and quiet, but in its very
silence there seemed to be strength.</p>

<p>It was gaining slowly, but she cheered it as she
saw it ascending, her eyes gleaming with excitement
as she watched it. “I know you’d like
to slide down the falls.” A hand was laid upon
her shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’d rather go up with the mist,” she answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Glenn Andrews, as though she was neither surprised
nor pleased by his sudden arrival.</p>

<p>“I got through my work earlier than I expected,”
he began. “When they told me how far
it was, I thought it would be too late for you to
come home alone.”</p>

<p>If he expected her to thank him for the consideration,
he was disappointed. The wind that
the falls generated had blown some of the waves
of her hair across her face. She carelessly
brushed it back with her hands. A strand of rebellious
hair, that seemed unmanageable, she
pulled out and threw away.</p>

<p>“Stop that.” Glenn tapped her fingers lightly.
“Haven’t I told you not to do that? It’s a crime
to ill use such hair as yours.”</p>

<p>Esther obeyed him, but could not resist the
impulse to say: “You may look like Christ, but
you can act like the devil.”</p>

<p>She saw him drop his head and walk a few
steps away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“You might as well have come on with me if
you were coming anyhow.”</p>

<p>He did not look at her.</p>

<p>“I told you I would come, if you would wait
until to-morrow. It was a poem for you I wanted
to finish.”</p>

<p>Esther went to his side, penitent; the act had
lost its sharp outlines to her.</p>

<p>“The words that you said someone would set
to music for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Let me see them, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do; I’m wild to read them.” Her eyes
lost their unconcern as she pleaded.</p>

<p>“You know I am in earnest when I say that
you will not have that pleasure. What’s the use
teasing?”</p>

<p>He was drumming on a rock with his boot
heel, as he leaned against a shrub. The stream
that caught the waterfall laughed and lathered
over its rocks as it flowed beside them. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
were of the most delicate tintings, pale lavenders,
green, and pink and blue. Glenn Andrews was
gazing at them.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such pretty shades as the
rocks of mountain regions take on? I’ve often
wondered what caused their coloring.”</p>

<p>With an aggrieved air, Esther allowed the
drift of interest to turn at his bidding.</p>

<p>“I supposed rocks were alike the world over.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you only know your own
beautiful ones; some day you’ll see the ugly ones;
then you needn’t bother to wonder what made
them so. Just kick them out of the way and
forget them.”</p>

<p>“Is that what you do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, when they are not too big for me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the hurt, when I stump my toe on
these pretty ones. It teaches me to go around
all I can. The jagged ones that I meet some
day needn’t think of being disturbed, if I can get
around them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“But sometimes they block the road, what
then?”</p>

<p>“I’d get somebody to help me over.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will have that good luck all your
days, Esther.”</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews’ voice had a minor sweetness.
The thought of contrasting her vagrant childhood
with the world she must one day know,
was singularly pathetic to him.</p>

<p>Stooping, he picked up a rock and cast it across
the waters.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said; “I was always lucky, that’s
how grandpa came to call me ‘God’s child.’”</p>

<p>“We’d better go now; it must be a good three
mile walk.” Glenn Andrews took particular
care to note her mood as they went along, the
wild charm of her unstudied grace, the vibrating
delight of life. How much happier she was than
if she had had her way.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the next Saturday before Glenn went
again to see Esther. Mr. Campbell entertained
him on the verandah. He sat some time, expecting
every minute to see Esther come bounding
out. Her grandfather looked so worn when he
came that Glenn felt it a sort of imposition to allow
him to talk long. Although their topic was
of deep interest, his shriveled features seemed to
smooth out as Glenn told him how rapidly Esther
had advanced that summer.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable,” he said, “how she can take
a piece and master it by herself. What she most
needs is encouragement; some one to keep her
interested and stimulated.”</p>

<p>“I had hoped to let her have lessons under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
professor at the University this year. It had
been my calculation a long time until she was
taken sick with fever.” The haggard look came
back to his face. “The doctor fears it will go into
typhoid.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that Esther is sick now?”
Glenn stammered.</p>

<p>“She took to her bed the same evening she
came back from the falls and hasn’t been up
since.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know a word of it. I should have
been over if I had known. I should have come
at once to see if I could do anything to help either
of you.”</p>

<p>Glenn’s steady mouth trembled. A tumult of
memories crowded upon him. He thought of
the Indian Well, where their lives first came together.
Suppose she had breathed in the germs
that day when she tried to protect him.</p>

<p>“Let me stay and help you nurse her, Mr.
Campbell, you look tired and need rest. I am
so strong and I have no ties to call me away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“You are very kind;” the rest was left unspoken,
for a hand was laid on his arm. Mr.
Campbell made his expression excuse his absence
as he turned and followed the negro girl.</p>

<p>Presently when he came back Glenn got up
hastily.</p>

<p>“Is she worse?”</p>

<p>“No, she wanted to know if it was not your
voice that she heard.”</p>

<p>“May I see her, if it is not asking too much?”</p>

<p>His face was full of sorrow as the old man
bowed and led the way. “She wanted to see
you.”</p>

<p>Esther’s eyes were closed; her head lay deep in
the pillow, the waves of her hair flowing back
from the whiteness of her face. “Esther,” he
whispered very softly. She opened her eyes and
her lips broke in a smile. He held out both
hands toward her and caught hers in their double
grasp, looking down in her face.</p>

<p>“How are you? I didn’t know until this minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
that you were not well. I came to take you
to the one place we’ve never been,” he told her.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe you had come to help me
over the rock.” She smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“Well, be very quiet; don’t worry about anything;
we’ll do all that for you. You know you
promised to play the piece you learned last week
for me. Let’s see, it was to be at the spring; that
was as close as we dared venture to Indian Well,
where we met.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give me out.” Her voice was weak
and low. “I expect to do that for your farewell;
you must get back to college in time.”</p>

<p>“How do you know but that I had rather be
detained; don’t run any risk.” This seemed to
please her.</p>

<p>“Is this better than the other life&#8212;the life
among your friends?”</p>

<p>“This is sweeter, for I am looking forward to
a lifetime with the world.” She smiled and
turned her head to rest it from the one position
she had kept too long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“It will be a year before the world can get you;
I am glad you have decided to take another degree,
although you seem to know enough already.”</p>

<p>“I know enough to realize just how little I do
know, but the special course along lines that I
am going to make my lifework is all that I shall
try to master yet. Everything has its turns; I’ll
learn it all in time, I hope.”</p>

<p>“And then you’ll be great.”</p>

<p>“More likely dead.”</p>

<p>“Most great people are.” Her lips suddenly
quivered.</p>

<p>“You take it slow. I couldn’t bear to think
of your dying.”</p>

<p>“You are talking too much now. You and
your grandpa take a rest. You both need it.”</p>

<p>“He must be tired after five nights and days,
but you are company. We can’t both leave you
at once.”</p>

<p>“I’ll play host now; go to sleep. I’ll be with
you all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Grandpa, lie down over there on the lounge.”</p>

<p>When he had humored her she cuddled down
contentedly and went to sleep.</p>

<p>With a ministering tenderness, Glenn kept
watch over her.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever was full of terrors to him. He
hoped that her fever was only due to the cold
she had taken at the falls.</p>

<p>It was very penetrating. He had ached a little
afterward and thought it was from being saturated
with the dampness that day. Suppose the
fear in her case was true. All that beautiful hair
would have to be shaved off. He jealously resented
this, caressing her hair as he looked at it.
The doctor came later and said her condition was
better and that she would be out in a few days.</p>

<p>Glenn drew a breath of relief. He would stay
during those few days.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Swinging</span> her violin case by the handle, Esther
started off through the cornfield, stopping
now and again to pull a spray of morning glories
that wreathed around the stalks to the tips of
their tassels. By the time she got in sight of the
Curtis house there were many of these branches
trailing over her. It was still early. The heavy
dew had dampened the dust on her shoes. She
tried to brush it off with the leaves she had gathered,
then bunching the blossoms of bright color
together she fastened them on her breast.</p>

<p>Just as she walked up Tagger was seated on
the steps of the back porch, getting Glenn Andrews’
boots in order for him. “Let me have the
brush a minute.” Esther took the brush, leaned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
over and cleaned the mud off of her own shoes.
Then she took up one of the boots and began to
polish it. A thrill of delight leaped through her at
the thought. She was working for him. When
she put it down the boot looked fresher and glossier
than it could ever look under Tagger’s care.
There was a sniffling sound and Esther looked
behind her. Tagger stood scouring in his eyes
with his shining fists, his small body quivering
with sobs.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“You’ll git my money,” he said through his
gasps.</p>

<p>“Well, for heaven’s sake! you little scamp, I
don’t want your nickel.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no nickel,” he blurted out. “He gimme
a quarter for turnin’ de cartwheel and standin’
on my head. Dat warn’t work; dat was play.”</p>

<p>Esther’s voice echoed through the halls.
When she stopped laughing, she said: “You poor
little mite, I hope he will give you the half of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
kingdom. Here, take the brush and earn your
fortune.”</p>

<p>As Tagger took up the other boot, to finish it,
Esther unclasped the bunch of morning glories
and tied them at the top of the one she had polished.
Seeing nothing of Glenn, and passing a
word with Mrs. Curtis who was busy in the dining
room, she went out to the flower garden.
About her in riotous health and beauty grew
flowers that gave no evidence of care. There
was a suggestion of wilfulness everywhere. The
sun had not been up long. It was splashing its
rays in the face of the great, slumbering mountains
like spray on the face of a sluggard. Glenn
walked up behind Esther as she bent over a white
rosebush in the heyday of its blooming.</p>

<p>“You did not waste time waiting for me.
This is worth seeing. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>As her face raised to his, how pure and radiant
it looked. The purity was heightened by the
flush.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could only do to them as I want to.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
She stretched her arms and brought them together
with a sigh. “I’d like to hold them close and
love them as hard as I could; then I’d be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“You’d crush them, break their stems and pay
the penalty of indulgence by pricking those arms
of yours by the wretched little briars hidden under
the beauty that you would spoil,” he said,
sharply.</p>

<p>He wanted her to see a lesson in this.</p>

<p>“That’s the way with life,” he said, watching
her break off one of the buds which she put in
his coat.</p>

<p>“Come on. You have got enough. I must
leave by two o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been ready longer than you&#8212;my violin
is on the porch. We can go by there to get it.”</p>

<p>At the start Glenn saw that Esther looked very
radiant, but suddenly the look of exaltation faded
from her face. He did not understand her mood.</p>

<p>Generally she enjoyed what he recalled to her,
visible or invisible, with the most exquisite feeling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
He dearly loved that trait in her. This
was not one of her receptive moods. She did
not seem to know when they got to the spring.</p>

<p>He indulged in an indolent sprawl upon the
grass, and she dropped down on the roots of a
tree by his side. He was an ideal lounger. That
was sufficient contentment for awhile. He was
trying to think it out without asking her.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he said at last. “Have I
hurt you&#8212;displeased you?” That passive gentleness
of manner was rarely changed. “Won’t
you tell me?” He placed his hand softly over
hers that lay on the ground. Her lashes, delicate
in their tinting, beat together, struggling to
catch the tears that tried to overflow. She pulled
away her hand and started to rise. The child’s
heart was almost breaking and the rebellious
tears that came, hot and fast, were dashed away
by little, mad hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Esther, have I hurt you? Don’t, don’t!
I’d rather you would strike me&#8212;anything but
that.” He sprang to his feet and bent over her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
“Are you disappointed in me. Have you found
too many flaws? Is it because I must go away?”
His soft, sad eyes regarded her uneasily. “If I
am the cause, haven’t I a right to know?”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to have to be told,” she said,
with shamed frankness, when she could command
her voice.</p>

<p>“If I had meant to, I wouldn’t; that is my justification.”</p>

<p>He touched her hair. “Come, this isn’t you&#8212;I
always liked that straightforward way of yours.
Don’t spoil our last day. Tell me, what’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“That’s what stings&#8212;you not only thought
little enough of them to throw them away; you
forgot it.”</p>

<p>There was a complaining note in her voice.
It was less anger than grief she felt. Her head
had the plaintive droop of a spoiled child asking
consolation.</p>

<p>“Do you mean the flowers on my boot; is
that all?” Slipping one hand in his pocket and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
pulling out a few, bruised, draggled morning
glories. An expression of joy flashed over her
wet face. A faint, amused gleam shot into his
serious eyes.</p>

<p>“Tagger used them for a handle, and I thought
their condition decided in favor of pressing
rather than wearing. I saved the pieces you see.”</p>

<p>“They were all the color of my dreams&#8212;I
couldn’t help but think that was the way they
would go some day.”</p>

<p>“If I can help it, they won’t.”</p>

<p>Taking out a notebook he dropped the flowers
between its leaves. Her girlish illusions were
dear to him. He wouldn’t destroy one of them.</p>

<p>“Here, let me get your violin. Play for me,
while I smoke.”</p>

<p>She took it from him, and he began smoking,
as she played for him the piece he had asked
her to learn. He could see the confidence she
had gained in herself. Patience was all that she
lacked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“There is yet another one I want you to learn
for me.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use? I may never see you again. I
don’t know that I’ll worry with it.”</p>

<p>The thought of his going away met with resentment
in her. She did not like to picture life
with his companionship withdrawn.</p>

<p>“Fiddledee humbug! I expect to see you
again lots of times. Maybe I’ll spend Christmas
day with the Curtises. I might come over awhile
at that time if you would ask me. I am not going
home just for a day. New York State is too far.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t divide you, I want the whole day
or nothing.” Esther leaned her elbow on the
violin case.</p>

<p>“I remember the first time I was ever offered
a piece of a whole thing. I was a very little girl.
I had a china plate that I always used at my place
at table, and one day a boy broke it in halves
and mended it. It had tiny green dots shaped
like a fence row around it, and I noticed one
place where the dots didn’t fit, and then I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
where they had pasted it together. A little chip
of it was gone. It nearly broke my heart. They
all said it was as good as new, but they couldn’t
make me see it in that way. What do you suppose
I did?”</p>

<p>“There is no telling.”</p>

<p>“It had been the pride of my life, but I took
that plate out, and broke it in pieces and strewed
them down the road to cut his feet when he came
by from school.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the feet of others had got the punishment?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t old enough to reason that out then.”</p>

<p>“Some people would have been sore enough
and revengeful enough not to care if they had. I
have known such instances, but I can understand
that your plate would never be the same to you
with a part of it gone. I don’t like anything incomplete
myself.”</p>

<p>“Give me the whole day&#8212;I want you all the
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“If you will promise me to learn every piece of
music that I ask you to, I will.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told the Curtises yet that you
were coming?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well,” her voice was merry, “that’s a bargain.”</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! ten minutes to two. I must go.”</p>

<p>They stood for a moment hand in hand. Not
a sound could be heard save the water lisping in
the spring. He touched her hair. “Beautiful
hair!” he half whispered. “If it had been cut
off, when you came so near having the fever, I
should have asked you to give me a curl.”</p>

<p>His veins throbbed with tenderness&#8212;between
these two there was a tie nearer than blood&#8212;the
tie of comradeship. One couldn’t think of relations
more subtle or pure.</p>

<p>“Give me your knife,” she said.</p>

<p>Glenn raised her face, touching her chin gently
with the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“No, no,” he said. “It is much prettier where
it is. I wouldn’t let you cut one off.”</p>

<p>She turned and closed her violin case with a
snap.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he had gone, Esther went back to the
woods. The thought of his coming with the
Christmas time kept her nature alive and glowing.
Her interest in music became more absorbing
than ever. She practiced for hours at a
stretch. This exceptional interest was a triumph
that had given the old grandfather a steadier
balance of mind, when during these years he
had tried to fill her mother’s place, nurturing,
encouraging the possibilities that lay in this
young soul, ennobling, inspiring a deeper meaning
to life. Glenn Andrews had helped him. He
appreciated that. They saw him occasionally
when they went in to her lessons. Esther seemed
to realize that Mr. Campbell was making a sacrifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
for her sake and every week the professor
could see the forward step she had made.</p>

<p>The college monthly came to her regularly
now. It always had poems or stories by Glenn
Andrews. All these she preserved. There was a
sort of reverence in her care of them. They
were a part of him&#8212;his creations. In the satisfaction
derived from them, she became more impatient
as to her own imperfections. The ripe,
rich beauty of autumn trailed by in all its glory
without the love it once had from her. Her
walks became less frequent. She felt a relief
when the snow first fell. Snow always suggested
Christmas. She kept such close watch that the
calendar was not needed to tell her when it was
near. In the innocence of her heart, she pictured
Glenn Andrews watching the hours go by
with the same impetuous eagerness&#8212;he who had
gone back to his old solitary life, as though nothing
had dropped in for a moment to change it.</p>

<p>It was Christmas. A light snow lay over the
valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Esther wrapped a hood close about her head
and walked back and forth on the verandah. A
low wind among the white boughs made a lullaby
for her longing.</p>

<p>The nearer the realization, the more impatient
she grew.</p>

<p>At last the sound of wheels, and the brisk stepping
of horses charmed her heart&#8212;he was coming.
She heard the sound of his voice as there
was a halt at the gate.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it, Mr. Glenn?”</p>

<p>“Who else did you expect?” asked Glenn Andrews,
stretching out his hand cordially to greet
her, enjoying the dignity she tried to assume. He
had speculated as to how she would meet him.</p>

<p>The fire roaring up the wide chimney was
sweeter than music to him. It had been a cold
ride. They were so glad to see him, Glenn
thought it was the next best thing to going home.</p>

<p>“Get up close and warm yourself.” Esther
shivered at the thought of his being cold.</p>

<p>“Let me have your coat, Mr. Glenn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“No, it’s too heavy; I’ll lay it over here.” Folding
it he threw it across a divan and drew his
chair up to the fire.</p>

<p>Esther leaned on the edge of the mantle, looking
at him. The wind had blown in her hair, it
lashed about her face, and with the old careless
gesture she tossed it back, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Have you been pulling that hair out again?”
said Glenn, with a sort of proprietary right.</p>

<p>“No, but I’ve been cutting it off.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t!” These words held the heat of
indignation.</p>

<p>“If you don’t believe it, I’ll prove it.”</p>

<p>She stepped over to him as she drew something
from her belt and pressed it in his hand.</p>

<p>“You know Christmas never came to you from
me before.” Just at that minute Mr. Campbell
came in. He settled himself in his own rocking
chair with a sigh of relief, as though he were
hypnotized by the warmth of the room. He
talked on and on, selecting topics upon which
neither seemed to have an idea. Esther had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
made her a lot of pillows out of some
old silk dresses of quaint patterns, and as she sat
amongst them, she was almost afraid to breathe
lest she split them. They smelled very strongly
of tobacco, having been so long packed away
in its leaves.</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews felt something soft and slim
between his fingers, but it puzzled him to know
what the texture was. He was restless with curiosity.</p>

<p>Esther enjoyed his perplexity with quiet
amusement, and was sorry when after a great
while her grandfather thought out for himself
that young folks enjoyed themselves better alone.</p>

<p>Glenn turned slyly to see him close the door
after him.</p>

<p>It was very interesting, this expectancy; he felt
something as he did when a child he had lain
awake all night waiting for Santa Claus to come.</p>

<p>His heart would leap with impatience at every
sound. The old chimney, drawing its heated
breath to keep his little body warm, had added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
to his irritation. It seemed to him that the wind
could cut more antics then than a circus pony
cavorting for his feed.</p>

<p>In its sound he constantly fancied he could
hear the coming of that old false ideal that had
been the first to fall, but it had not fallen until
many a little prayer had been answered and
many a young dream been realized. Such ideals
leave their imprint upon the mind. The memory
of the joy it gave softens and purifies the heart
before it awakens.</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews leaned over and opened his
hand to the light; it was a watch chain, made of
Esther’s hair.</p>

<p>“That slide was on a chain my mother wore,”
she said.</p>

<p>The sentiment of it made him feel that he
stood at the white sanctity of her soul with its
opening and unfathomable depths.</p>

<p>He raised the chain to his lips and kissed it
affectionately. He could not have thanked her
in words. He realized that:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“Sentiment that is real is not acquired&#8212;it
flows into the veins like the breath of the sea
waves, completely freshening every sense with its
presence.”</p>

<p>Glenn took up his overcoat and brought out
a music roll with her name mounted in silver.</p>

<p>“It is full and you are to learn it all. That’s
the agreement.” He laid it open before her.</p>

<p>“The very hardest that you could find.”</p>

<p>“Just what you need.”</p>

<p>Esther hummed a bar here and there as she
turned the pages. She was in an ecstasy of content.
A lilting joyousness of Glenn Andrews’
presence was in everything she did and said.</p>

<p>They lingered over the Christmas dinner. Mr.
Campbell told yarns of the olden times when he
was a boy on that holiday. He took his pleasure
in their company at the table, and afterwards left
them alone again.</p>

<p>They made an exceptionably cozy picture, sitting
together in front of the wood fire. It was
beautiful to see the snow outside, falling in tiny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
siftings, displaced by the snow birds’ restless
stirring.</p>

<p>Glenn and Esther were so comfortable. How
could it be winter out there. He smoked and
she read him selections from his own poems&#8212;the
ones she liked best. He had no idea she
could read so well&#8212;it must have been her reading
them that made them sound better than he
had ever thought them before. There was a slow
unfolding of her woman nature as he watched
her. It was almost imperceptible, yet so much
surer than a sudden burst.</p>

<p>“You’ll keep on with your lessons?” he asked.</p>

<p>“After this year grandpa won’t be able to
afford it.”</p>

<p>“But it will never do for you to stop now. I
was talking with the professor the other day
about your art. He is interested in it. He
wants to study English; maybe he would exchange&#8212;if
you could teach him. Do you think
you could?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“What! I a teacher?” She clasped her hands
involuntarily. “But suppose he’d let me try?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see if he will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you, sure enough?” She was now
seated closer by Glenn, listening with an absorbing
interest.</p>

<p>“When will I know?”</p>

<p>“There is a lot of time between now and next
September. You’ll finish out this year, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, except when the weather is too bad
for grandpa. He’s getting old, you know.”</p>

<p>Glenn could see how he was failing.</p>

<p>It was about dusk when the buggy drove away
from the front steps. The parting was cordial
and yet it seemed to lack something for both.
Perhaps grandpa’s being there complicated the
situation. Whatever it was, in both their hearts
there seemed something lacking.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> coming of June brought an end to college
life for Glenn Andrews. He had had a letter
a few days before, deciding an important
question&#8212;in fact, the question of the greatest
importance to him just then. While he was waiting
for Esther he read it over again:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“New York City.</p>

<p>“My dear Andrews&#8212;Of course I hadn’t forgotten
my promise nor my interest in you. It
seems a lifetime since I stood in those priestly
looking robes on that old stage waiting to receive
my discharge and hustle or go hungry.
You were at the foot then. I remember you;
a solemn-faced chap, but mightily in earnest.
I am glad that you are at the head, and ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
for the fight&#8212;the thick of it. I always knew
that was the kind of metal you were made of, so
it does me good to be able to give you a boost.
You are to be associate editor of the magazine&#8212;give
up most of your freedom and take an editor’s
chair.</p>

<p>“You may come right on. I wonder what you
will be like after all these years since we cavorted
over that campus. Yours fraternally,</p>

<p class="right">“Richmond Briarley.”</p></div>

<p>What did Glenn care for slavery? His love
for his profession would even up scores. Going
among strangers had no depressing effect upon
him. He was singularly fitted for that kind of
thing. He believed that every soul should be
alone a part of its existence, away from the
sight, the touch of affection, and seek deeper
self acquaintance and understanding. This was
how he came to cultivate his passion to know and
be something.</p>

<p>Now he was going to try his hand&#8212;his life
was to be full of interest and effort, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
training he had given to his faculties were to be
exercised and tested. Esther joined him presently
to go for their last ramble.</p>

<p>“You are to lead the way anywhere. I am
with you to-day,” he said.</p>

<p>Glenn felt a subtle sadness at leaving her. This
human study had been most interesting to
him, nor would it be the least of his regrets for
what must be given up. The others were finished,
he had reached the last page.</p>

<p>During the stroll, Glenn told her that the professor
had agreed to make the exchange he spoke
of at Christmas.</p>

<p>“Now you are to promise me that you will
keep up your art. Don’t let circumstances overwhelm
you.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t keep from trying to go on, if I
wanted to, but when you get away you’ll forget
about me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall.”</p>

<p>He was very calm. No matter what he
thought or felt, he didn’t intend to drop a word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
that might disquiet her mind or disturb their
tranquil sense of comradeship.</p>

<p>“I expect you to do something some day.
You’ll not stay buried down here all your life.
You were not born for oblivion.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will be disappointed in me.
But I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>She looked down, pulling at the moss on the
log.</p>

<p>His going so far away was her first great sorrow.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I would though if I didn’t have
next summer to look forward to; you said you
would try to come back then.”</p>

<p>With her simplicity and daring directness she
added. “Take good care of yourself, Mr. Glenn,
for all the world couldn’t fill your place in my
heart.”</p>

<p>“You think that now, Esther. You seem to
see something complete in our friendship. It is
all you want. A day will come when you’ll understand
that it is not satisfying. The mist of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
morning is on the hills, and hides the outlines of
the landscape; you can see but a little way. After
awhile it will gradually lift, and give you a
clearer and broader view.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I know you can’t see it now. The ripening
of your nature will show you the good fruit, and
of how little use it was to cry over the pretty
petals when it dropped its bloom.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, her lips parting as she
slowly grasped the drift of his words.</p>

<p>“Patience and faith are what you must have.”</p>

<p>“The patience I would have to borrow, or steal,
for I never did have any of my own.”</p>

<p>It was going to be the hardest lesson for her
to learn.</p>

<p>She took the knife he was toying with, and
asked suddenly:</p>

<p>“Put your foot up a minute.”</p>

<p>He was wondering what she would do.</p>

<p>“I’m going to leave something for you to remember
me by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>She began carefully to etch a sentence across
the upper part of the leather.</p>

<p>“Bear harder, cut it&#8212;that little scratching
won’t last&#8212;as long as you are putting it there.”</p>

<p>His eyes rested on her hair, that lay like a
crown on her bowed head.</p>

<p>Slowly she cut each letter. “Don’t look until
I get through.”</p>

<p>The fine, sharp blade was doing its work well;
there was just one more word. She made a
slip and the keen point plunged through. “Oh,
did that touch you?” Suddenly withdrawing it
she saw the blood leap out and run down his
boot leg. Her eyes opened wide; the despair in
them was enough to move him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Glenn, what have I done to you?”</p>

<p>“It’s only a pin scratch; don’t think of it.” He
tried to console and reassure her.</p>

<p>She began unwinding the soft mull tie she
wore. “I know you’ll bleed to death if we can’t
stop it.”</p>

<p>He had taken his boot off. With tender,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
trembling fingers she was binding the cloth to his
leg, winding it around again and again, trying
to wrap out the sight of the blood.</p>

<p>It was no use, in a second the red stain would
radiate over the white surface.</p>

<p>“What shall I do! oh, forgive me, forgive me!”</p>

<p>She knelt down and pressed his knee in her
arms and bent over it with tears, the incense
of her love mingling with self-reproach. Her
penitence was pathetic.</p>

<p>He regarded her grief with compassionate softness.
This came near disarming his resolve. He
wanted to take her in his arms as he had never
done in his life. As she held the wound close,
he resisted the impulse to flinch.</p>

<p>“I’m all right, don’t you worry.”</p>

<p>He read the line on the boot.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t take anything for that. It will
sweeten the absence, and I hope this scratch will
make a scar that I may wear all my life to remember
you by.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never forgive myself for it&#8212;never!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t say that. It’s a little thing after all.
See, I walk all right. Let’s go home.” Putting
one hand on her shoulder they started off, Esther
watching every step he took with fear and
alarm.</p>

<p>“Are you telling the truth. Don’t it hurt you
to walk?”</p>

<p>Turning his face away, he bit his lips.</p>

<p>“Not much, you know there is always a little
soreness, no matter how slight the cut.”</p>

<p>He wouldn’t tell that the knee was a very dangerous
place to receive a wound.</p>

<p>All the way the joint was stiffening and getting
more painful. His face beamed in the effort to
conceal his suffering. When they reached the
steps he leaned his head against a column; he
was wearied and felt that he could bear no
more.</p>

<p>“Come, lie down; I’ll fix the bed for you and
find grandpa,” she urged.</p>

<p>“No, come back; I’ll sit here on the step
awhile. I must be going soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Dear little heart, he would never while he
lived forget her.</p>

<p>“How can you go, hurt as you are?”</p>

<p>“Sit down here by me, I have but a few minutes
with you. I ordered my horse for five
o’clock.”</p>

<p>Without further resistance she took the seat.
She had not forgotten that his will was the only
one she ever met stronger than her own.</p>

<p>“Forgive me?” looking up to him, she asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t use that word between us.” He gathered
her hands in his own, partly for fear she
might touch his knee. Soon his horse came
around.</p>

<p>“Poor cripple,” Esther said with a caressing
accent, stretching her hand toward his knee, as
he mounted. Then she pressed her hands hard
against her eyelids as he said good-bye. When
she looked up again he was gone. She stood
sighing as if her soul would leave her body, as he
rode on at a gallop, outlined against the far blue
of the hills.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first shock of Glenn Andrews’ absence
was a bitter trial to Esther, who grieved unreasoningly.
His going seemed like the end of the
world. It was over, those rare, dear days of
smiles and tears, of trifling quarrels and sweet
reconciliations. She wondered how she had ever
thought the sky was so blue, the grass so green.</p>

<p>Through all of her desolation, however, ran the
thought that he wished nothing so much as for
her to advance in her art.</p>

<p>Would she let the first rock block her way?
Youth can forget its grief. She was so unconsciously
true to him, that before she scarcely realized
it, she was back at work, harder than ever.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
She began teaching the kind old German musician
English to pay for her instructions.</p>

<p>Heart, brain and soul she gave to her art, not
all for its sake nor hers, but for the man that was
the world’s best type to her.</p>

<p>The devotion with which she had worshipped
him was for the time transferred to the violin
that became the absorbing and crowning ambition
of her life.</p>

<p>Glenn had been gone nearly a year. The summer,
instead of bringing him, brought a disappointment.</p>

<p>He wrote her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fate or Providence has put in its oar to the
exclusion of my own interesting plans. I didn’t
dare really hope that I should see you this summer,
even while I planned the trip. Providence
would never be so kind as that. I am ordered
to Athens to do some special work for our magazine.
They have been unearthing some more
wonderful curiosities there. This is the last note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
I write before going abroad, for I sail early to-morrow
morning. How much easier it is to learn
things than to unlearn them. I used to think
differently at college. Very many times, more than
I will admit to myself, I have closed my eyes and
tried to imagine that I should open them upon
yours, gazing disapprovingly at my ‘steenth’
cocktail. Many times I have been glad when I
opened them that it was not so&#8212;at others I have
been a little sorry. There is a deliciousness about
your not being with me which is quite a new sensation.
I shall never again pity the old Flagellants.
I know now that there was a certain
ecstasy of pleasure for them which we have taken
too little account of. There is a pleasure in not
writing to you, too; I am writing now because I
know if I don’t I shall not hear again from you,
and I confess that I don’t want my flagellation
to take that shape. You were growing when I
left you. Have you stopped? Don’t stop thinking&#8212;don’t
stop striving&#8212;don’t stop hoping.
You have no lack of imagination, inspiration, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
you need the cold, cruel leaven of fact. Your
symphony needs less harp and more violin. The
Jews are clinging to their old ideals. The Gentiles
crucified it, and have a living gospel. Let
them die if they won’t live without nursing. You
don’t want them. (I mean the ideals&#8212;not the
Jews this time&#8212;metaphors always proved too
much for me.) And finally don’t preach to
others as I am doing to you. It’s a bad habit and
never does any good. But remember that there
are a few misguided and dreamy creatures who
think you may do something one of these days
if you ever get your eyes rubbed open wide
enough.</p>

<p>For the next year his habitual haunts would
know him no more. He would combine with his
trip a while in Paris. Casting aside all obligation
he entered into the spirit of the life about
him. Paris, with all its dangers, all its charms,
the extraordinary influence of that congenial life,
touched him with a glowing heat of inspiration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
He revelled in his hopes&#8212;in his dreams. Here
he would write something worthy of him. His
nature was rich in the vivid impressions, intense
feelings and fine thoughts which make life full
of real meaning and significance. Here he saw
many sides of it&#8212;much of it was meaningless
and distasteful, and repelled all of his finer senses,
but “it is in experience that one sees all that is
most vile and all that is most beautiful.” This
was an excellent opportunity. All the while he
was maturing&#8212;beginning to have a more tolerant
knowledge of his fellow man. His heart was
kindlier&#8212;the weight of his judgment lighter.</p>

<p>Half the world away, Esther was sorrowing
for him&#8212;the memory of the disappointment he
had caused touched deep fibres in her that ached
and ached and ached. Besides this, she could
see her old grandfather growing feebler with the
setting of every sun. His small stock of vitality
was slipping away.</p>

<p>He knew that the stalk was withered, and soon
must fall, yet he tried to face the truth in smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
silence. Sometimes&#8212;when he thought of the
hands that had so longed to have control of his
child&#8212;the anguish in him overflowed. They
would soon have her in their grasp.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Campbell</span> did not live through the winter.</p>

<p>Esther was left to the care of his nephew, living
in a remote part of the valley.</p>

<p>One morning, when she had rocked one of the
children to sleep, she sat with it in her arms, gazing
out on the gloomy day with sad, set eyes.
For the time being she lost all memory of the
scene about her. The laughter of the children,
the woman leaning over the bed, cutting small
garments out of coarse cloth. She began to remember
all that her grandfather had meant to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
her. She recalled his tenderness, the strong
fortress of his great love built between the world
and her. It had crumbled so slowly that she
didn’t comprehend that it could ever wear quite
away, until it had crumbled to the ground. True
he was dead, but he had made a defense for her
even beyond the gulf. Though stinted in many
things, he had always held to his life insurance.
The farm was worn out&#8212;the house old&#8212;it would
bring little, but the two together would help her
to maintain her independence until she could
master her art. He did not know the years or
the money that it required&#8212;he only felt that
through the medium of her art she might hold
some of the dignity of position to which she was
entitled by right of birth. Knowing this, Esther
yearned with her heart and soul to go forward.
His lofty, beautiful character shone out before
her mind without a flaw. The thought of again
taking up the task alone was sweetened and ennobled
by that memory.</p>

<p>The woman glanced at Esther as she laid aside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
one pattern, put the pins in her mouth until she
could place another. She was a saffron-faced,
stoop-shouldered woman&#8212;one who prided herself
on the drudgery she could do, who welcomed,
rather than flinched from hardships.</p>

<p>“What are you studyin’ about now?”</p>

<p>Esther shuddered as she recalled the present.</p>

<p>“You ain’t thinking about startin’ up that fiddlin’
again, are you?” the other stopped short
to ask. A shadow crossed the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“Jenny told me you had got it into your head
to take lessons again from that old Dutchman at
the college.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about it,” Esther answered
calmly.</p>

<p>“Goodness knows I wouldn’t! I always
thought the fiddle warn’t for anybody but men
and niggers.” Her high-pitched voice was piercing.
“Georgy got a juice harp somewhere, and I
took it away from him and burnt the fetched
thing up. I have always heard: ‘Let your children
learn music if you want ’em to be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
’count.’” She stopped to get her breath. “Your
cousin John thinks it’s an outrage&#8212;the idea of
your taking lessons again. He knows nothing
t’all about the man&#8212;but foreigners are a bad lot.”</p>

<p>“Did cousin John tell you that he opposed the
idea?” Esther interrupted her to ask.</p>

<p>“He didn’t seem to take to it, any more than
your trapsin’ over the woods by your lone self.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you he thought that was wrong?”</p>

<p>“Well, not in so many words, but I can tell
when a thing goes against the grain with him.
He don’t like to hurt you. I tell him he thinks
more of your feelings than your character. I
just took it upon myself to tell you for your own
good.”</p>

<p>The woman’s speech was harsh and to the
point. She continued abruptly:</p>

<p>“You might do your own washin’ and ironin’
too, instead of hirin’ it all the time. You couldn’t
do up a pocket-handkerchief.”</p>

<p>Esther got up, and laid the baby in the crib;
her arms ached so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“If you knew how to do anything you might
help me with all this sewin’.” She laid one knotty
hand on a heap of it piled beside her.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how, but I will hire that part
of it done, which you think I should do,” she said
gently, looking straight at the woman.</p>

<p>“When cousin John wouldn’t take any money
for my board, I asked him to let me work for the
worth of it. I didn’t ask him to make it easy
for me. He has a big family. I wanted to earn
my way.”</p>

<p>“He does think you try to earn it,” she admitted
generously, “but I think it’s mighty easy
for you myself. You ought to be very thankful.
Look at the time you have&#8212;the whole blessed
evenin’. You have nothin’ but to help Jenny
with the children, and the cookin’ and the milkin’&#8212;what’s
three cows to milk? I have seen the
day, before the family was so big, when I could
do all the work on the place and not half try.”</p>

<p>Esther made a brave effort to control the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
strong spirit within her. From the start the
other had persisted in misinterpreting her emotions,
misunderstanding her ambitions. She kept
guard of herself, for this was her cousin’s wife.</p>

<p>“When do you get the mail out here?” Esther
tried to change the subject.</p>

<p>“When do we get the mail?” she repeated with
intense disgust.</p>

<p>“Every time we send to mill, that’s four or five
times a year too often, to get those papers that
John will take; readin’ those vile things is the
ruination of the country. I keep ’em from the
children the same as if they were scorpions. As
for letters, we don’t get many. Most people we
care about live closer to us than the post office.
You lookin’ for any?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get one.”</p>

<p>“From that college man? I reckon he’s forgot
you are in existence.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” Esther said, with an indifferent
show of pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“He was curious looking to me; the way he
wore his hair was abominable.”</p>

<p>“He’s my friend. I’d rather not talk of him.”</p>

<p>“That’s no reason he’s too good to be talked
about.”</p>

<p>“As you please.” Reaching for her hat Esther
started toward the door.</p>

<p>“You’d better let ’lone fightin’ for him and
learn some common sense. You’d never get
married if men knew how little account you was.
When I was your age I’d been married three
years,” she said, proudly. “If you don’t want to
be an old maid you’d better settle down and marry.”
Esther closed the door as she uttered the
last word.</p>

<p>“Marry? What? A plowboy, a pedler, or a
washing machine agent?” That would have
been her cousin’s wife’s idea.</p>

<p>She wondered as she said this to herself what
had become of all those people we hear of who
“married and lived happily ever afterward.” A
sob caught in her throat, and she almost ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
until she was out of sight and sound of the woman’s
voice.</p>

<p>Esther Powel at eighteen, and in her young,
fresh beauty&#8212;this was the offering she would
immolate on the altar of her limitations.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Instead</span> of resorting to the woods, her old
friend, Esther made her way down to the plum
thicket. The honey bees were humming to the
heart of the blossoms.</p>

<p>Throwing herself full length upon the ground,
she lay in a white drift of them. An hour or more
was given to heartrending sobs of utter grief
and abandonment of everything in the whole
world.</p>

<p>The pathos of her starved, unsympathetic existence,
living in isolation among people as heavy
as wet clay. All the sentiment, thought, passion,
of her being had no outlet&#8212;none of the cravings
of her youth had been satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Between her and Glenn Andrews the silence
had been unbroken for almost a year.</p>

<p>As she lay there looking up, with her arms
folded under her head, her heart almost bursting
with a sense of her own helplessness, she pictured
herself accepting the knowledge that she
would never see him again. All the unhealthy
fancies born of loneliness and sorrow possessed
her. The day was gray. The steel rim of the
sky seemed to fit the woods. She watched it
with a stifling sensation. It looked as if it would
soon bend the trees double and close in, shutting
down upon the narrow space in which she lived.</p>

<p>She remembered to have seen her grandfather
turn an old, worn pan of granite down upon his
early tomato slips. He did this to keep out the
light, until they could get strength enough to
stand the hardier growth&#8212;he did it to force
them. The consistence of nature’s laws she did
not understand.</p>

<p>She only knew that to-day for her was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
lonely, narrow and dark, and to-morrow would
be another to-day when it came.</p>

<p>She went back to the house with a dull expression
of hopelessness in her eyes.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> the days passed&#8212;the cold, wretched days.
Esther was sewing diligently, making both
sleeves for one arm, blundering on everything
she undertook, until it exhausted her teacher’s
patience. For some time she was less a help
than a hindrance&#8212;yet she was sewing.</p>

<p>One evening she dropped her work and went
out to meet her cousin John. She often met
him when he came home. This time she was
unusually anxious. He had been to mill.</p>

<p>“Well, you are back; we’ve missed you,” she
said.</p>

<p>Mixed with her love for him was a big proportion
of pity. He had such a hard, stupid
kind of life and had never been appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, youngster!” he greeted her, with his
stout, strident voice. “What’ll you give me for
a letter&#8212;a two-pounder?”</p>

<p>“It depends on where it’s from.”</p>

<p>“Paris, France.”</p>

<p>“No? Really?”</p>

<p>Holding a package just above her head, he
read: “Mademoiselle Esther Powel, Etats Unis
d’Amerique. He’s sending back all your old
letters. This looks as if it might hold a dozen
or two.”</p>

<p>“They are not mine,” she cried, as, laughing,
she leaped and snatched it from his hand.</p>

<p>“Glenn Andrews,” she repeated, breathlessly,
holding the writing before her eyes. Without a
word she stole away, to read it alone. He loved
her, this cousin of hers, this practical, unimaginative
man, but he had never understood her.
Her ideas were not his ideas, nor her hopes his
hopes, but he was proud of her in an uncomprehending
manner and he smiled at her aspirations
as at his boy baby’s ambition to drive the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
mules. A thrill crept down to her heart. It was
a book exquisitely bound, bearing Glenn Andrew’s
name. She fondled its pages, ran her
hand lovingly over their smooth surface. The
book opened to a folded paper, on which were
some notes jotted down for the violin, an accompaniment
to a song that he had written.</p>

<p>Turning the leaves, she came to a card; a line
on the back of it read: “You can learn this.
Let me hear at New York address after April.”
It was dropped by a poem, “My Little Love of
Long Ago.”</p>

<p>This girl, gifted with all the subtlety of rare
natures, understood. Her face quivered with
tenderness as she gazed at it. The world was full
of light&#8212;somebody in it took an interest in her.
This had fallen like some faint, soft fragrance in
her life. Between laughter and tears she read
the poem:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Esther was radiant with joy. She sped over
the ground like a wild young deer, running to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the house for her long-forsaken violin. She carried
it to the back of the orchard. She propped
the music up in the low fork of an apple tree, and
wrestled with the opening bars. It was written
in a minor key and was the most difficult accompaniment
she had ever seen. Over and over
again she tried to bring out the plaintive harmony
that was there. She had to give it up at
last&#8212;it was beyond her reach&#8212;it challenged her.
This caused her flickering ambition to flash up
anew.</p>

<p>A new resolve glowed in her eyes. To be
thwarted in a thing was touching upon an acutely
sensitive nerve. She would not rest until
she had beaten down every obstacle between her
and her hope of attainment. She would free herself
of these maddeningly narrow surroundings.</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews immediately answered her letter,
found upon his arrival in New York. He
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“You have lived among the flowers, had great
grief, and now the flowers do not console you.
And yet, if you only knew it, nature is a thousand
times better at consolation than human beings.
I long ago gave up looking for consolation
from people&#8212;I can get it from flowers.
Maybe it is because I don’t live among them.
In lieu of flowers, I take work, and the grind I
go through takes the edge off griefs, joys and
ambitions. It reduces one to the dead level of
passiveness, which is not ecstatic, but which does
not hurt. So I might say to you: ‘If the flowers
do not console you, try work’&#8212;but, doubtless,
you have been working. I know that you are
capable of it. Perhaps time has worn off the
brunt of your sorrow and you are feeling the after
pain of loneliness&#8212;which is even worse to bear,
because less vivid and more constant.</p>

<p>“You ought to do something some day with
your art. If you only know it, you are not unfortunately
situated as regards your future. Try
and look at it that way. Lift up your head and
throw your shoulders back. Go and look in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
looking-glass and make a face at yourself, and
remember you are not an editor, that your nose
is not on the grind-stone and that you have, after
all, something to thank God for.”</p>
</div>

<p>Esther had been faithful to the impulse of that
day. She slaved with a resolution painful to see.
In that year she had changed, developed greatly.
The kindly old professor regarded her with pride
as he sat listening to her, after she had conquered
the music Glenn Andrews had sent to
her. There was a sweep of magnificence in it.</p>

<p>At the last of the year there came a change. The
old professor was leaving for a broader field.
He encouraged her to make an effort for the
highest mark; her next step, in his opinion,
should be New York. Of course, it would take
self-sacrifice, he told her; “but what is sacrifice
when one is at the center of the world?”</p>

<p>New York, which she had feared, and which
had always seemed to her so great and so far.
New York that now stood for all the hope in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
her life. After the professor had gone she began
turning his advice over in her mind. She
could go no further here. She might there. But
the struggle to keep up the pace in New York
while she was doing it, would probably throttle
all the ambition and freshness she had as capital
to begin with. She thought of people she loved
who had gone. She could not turn out ill after
all their care. She might accomplish something
in spite of the difficulties. Lots of people had.
Her impulse was to dare until, under the heat of
its spell, she wrote a line to Glenn Andrews.</p>

<p>“What do you think of New York for me?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> do I think of New York for you?”
Glenn Andrews replied, “frankly I don’t know.
You forget that the one thing necessary to answer
your question is the one thing I don’t possess.
That is to say, I don’t know you as time
has made you. What I would have said years
ago to the slip of a girl, I cannot say to the growing
woman. You and your art are the deciding
quantities. Have you bodily strength, or only
nerve fibre? Have you real genius, or only mediocrity?
Genius, which lives by self-understanding,
can forgive this blunt questioning. New
York takes strength. It is a great monster
which grips you by the throat and shakes you as
a dog does a squirrel. The process shakes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
life out of its body and leaves it broken and dead,
or else it twists its neck, bites strong and deep,
and is allowed to go. You must draw blood to
make the monster of city life quit&#8212;the rich,
warm blood of enthusiasm and applause. And I
doubt whether your teeth are strong enough.</p>

<p>“Success means hard work&#8212;long, bitter days
and nights of it&#8212;drab days of monotony, black
nights of disappointment. It means toil and
tears. This is a maelstrom, and only the biggest
branches float on the surface. The little twigs
are sucked down. And it is a place of giant timber.
The oak from the country hillside is only
a scrub here. You must remember this. The
bigness of it all makes for heartlessness. When
one meets a beggar on every corner, one soon
ceases to feel sorry; and where failures are so
common, there is seldom a helping hand or even
a sigh of sympathy. Only the warmest fire can
go on burning brightly with the ice falling so
thick around it.</p>

<p>“So much for you yourself, and your own view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
of yourself. As to your ability, I mean. Your
circumstances I do not know. New York takes
money. In comparison with your own home, it
takes a great deal. To succeed in it requires time&#8212;years;
and unless you can afford to stay it
through, you would better save yourself the discouragement
of failure, for there is no bitterer
failure than that which we feel to be purely circumstantial.</p>

<p>“I pass over the question of the evil of New
York. Evil comes from inside of us&#8212;it is not
absorbed. If we are pure, it does not touch us; it
goes by. I believe it would go by you. There
are no temptations in New York any more than
there are at home, for those who do not want to
be tempted. You are, no doubt, a far better
judge of this matter than your minister&#8212;I am
heterodox enough for that.</p>

<p>“There is another side. No one knows genius
so well as itself. If you have it, New York is the
place for you. The greater the body, the greater
the attraction for the great centre. I would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
counsel you to disregard its force, for I believe
only true motives move you. And if you know
yourself and believe in yourself, you will find
a way to beat down other difficulties. There are
ways of living in New York cheaply. You might
essay the purgatorial round of music lessons;
your violin might earn its own halo&#8212;who
knows?</p>

<p>“I take it you would come alone. There are
places where young women, unattended, are
made welcome and cared for; and there are
places where earnest workers congregate where
there are ordinary comforts at low rates&#8212;these,
if you should decide to try the venture, you must
let me tell you of. I should be glad indeed if
what knowledge I have of the city might be of
some service to you.</p>

<p>“In closing this letter, I feel that, after all, I
have told you nothing. You have, no doubt, considered
the question in all its bearings. Such a
step is a serious one&#8212;far too much so for me to
intrude upon it. Be true to yourself&#8212;to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
ideas, your judgment, and your reason. If you
do this, you will be true to your art. Do not
hesitate to write me if I can help you, but you
must not ask me to advise you as to coming.
‘What do I think of New York for you?’ I don’t
know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> was a man who had lost the romance of
life. Not a shred of sentiment was left.</p>

<p>Richmond Briarley strode about his den, pulling
his smoking jacket from a pair of vicious-looking
antlers above the door, his slippers from
the wings of Cupid poised above the glorious
Psyche.</p>

<p>There was a princely abandon in the luxurious
den he called “home.” Looking about it, one
would conceive him to be a man quite beyond
the ordinary&#8212;if the trophies, pictures, statuary,
bespoke his individuality.</p>

<p>“Don’t wait for me, Andrews, go ahead,” he
called out from an alcove.</p>

<p>If his heart was not open to his friends, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
finest wines were, and the one is often mistaken
for the other.</p>

<p>Richmond Briarley had ample, irregular features,
hair and eyes the blackest black, and an
olive gray complexion. There was something
stoic in the closing of his lips, set around with
circular wrinkles, revealing the traits peculiar to
his type. He hadn’t the least regard for the past,
nor fault to find with the future.</p>

<p>Coming out, he poured a glass of wine and
drank with Glenn Andrews.</p>

<p>“Have a smoke,” glancing towards a tabourette,
strewn with pipes, some of them disreputable
enough to the eye.</p>

<p>“Take any of them, you won’t be smoking any
old, dry, dead memories&#8212;these are all ‘bought’
ones.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help myself. I was just reading my mail.
The boy handed it to me as I was leaving the office.”</p>

<p>Folding a sheet of paper on which was written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
only a name and address, he took up one of
the pipes and began filling it.</p>

<p>So Esther Powel was in town. It was a daring
entrance upon life for this little hard-headed,
soft-hearted Southerner. He looked thoughtful;
the soberness of his youth, rather than the labor
of his manhood, had lightly marked his face. A
sudden apprehension seized him for the pure,
sweet life he knew so well. It was almost as
much as her life was worth to come here so
pretty and so friendless. She needed protection.</p>

<p>This thought took possession of his mind to
the exclusion of all else. In the old days he had
been the only one who could bend her wayward
will. Her faith in him was the blind unquestioning
faith of a child. Her own feeling for him she
did not reason with. She accepted it as a fact
which was beyond her analysis. Under its spell
she had grown and flourished against great odds.
Why should she not continue to do so?</p>

<p>“Briarley,” Glenn went on, filling his pipe, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
packing it down with his thumb. “Suppose you
knew a girl who was coming here alone, to study
art, what would you consider the very best way
to shield her?”</p>

<p>“By keeping away from her.”</p>

<p>“But, suppose she needed some one to look to&#8212;suppose
she were young and knew no one.
City life is a fiercely hardening process, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I’d get some woman friend to show her all
there was to see, and that might cure her. So-called
sin charms because it’s unknown.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think a girl’s love, if not unappreciated,
is a shield and an inspiration?”</p>

<p>Briarley shook his head.</p>

<p>“Oh! of course, I forgot. You don’t believe in
love.”</p>

<p>“I do, as much as I believe in any other hell.”</p>

<p>Andrews was silent.</p>

<p>“Have your fun out, then we’ll be serious.”</p>

<p>Their views were directly opposite, yet the enthusiasm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
of each made ground for respect, if not
agreement.</p>

<p>“While you now admit such a phantasy, Andrews,
you get the credit of living by the head.
It is generally understood that you never let
scruples of the heart stand in the way.”</p>

<p>“I am not a woman; besides, it is a matter of
self-denial, and not unbelief. My love is my
profession&#8212;long ago I made my choice between
woman and art&#8212;if I had chosen woman
that love would have ruled my life. I have given
over much for my work; it has demanded sacrifice.
I am just now beginning to prove myself
equal to its despotic sovereignty. Briarley, unless
you have tried for one thing all your life, you
can’t conceive how bewildering and sweet a burst
of it is for the first time. Under no conditions
whatever would I sacrifice my best aims, my
highest ambitions. It is better to be than to
have. That’s my philosophy.”</p>

<p>“Go on. Every man has the right to work
out his own destiny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Briarley filled his glass again. “The way he
can get the most satisfaction is the way he generally
chooses.”</p>

<p>“Satisfaction hurts the soul. There is nothing
worse than satiety of the senses. I would never
let myself become thoroughly satisfied.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t ask for more than the success
of that last book. The critics rendered you distinguished
services,” said Briarley. “I understand
the sale was enormous.”</p>

<p>“It has sold very well, but that only forces me
to wrestle the harder to keep up the standard
of that reputation. If I cared for a woman, my
heart and soul could be loyal to her, but my
time and vitality belong entirely to my art. ‘Women
are born to live and love. They only really
live after they love.’”</p>

<p>Andrews went on as though the other had endorsed
his doctrine. “Love is an uplifting force
to genius. A man would be doing a chivalrous
act to win and hold the devotion of a girl in such
an instance as I have cited.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“It would be a risk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but in my judgment the advantage is
much greater than the risk.”</p>

<p>“It would be a responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I like responsibility; it braces a man to bear
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, the fellow who carries out your mad
project will settle for his folly.”</p>

<p>“If he did, I’d stand by him in it.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t stand by himself. There’d be the
trouble&#8212;he’d fall.”</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews knocked the ashes from his
pipe and got up, straightening his shoulders and
smoothing his hair with his hands. His mind
was made up. He did not expect to fall.</p>

<p>Knowing himself to be his own master, he felt
that to lend himself to anything that would hurt
her ideal of him would be impossible.</p>

<p>“Where now?”</p>

<p>“To find somebody looking for trouble,” Glenn
said, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t forget the Sunday night concert, Andrews.
I’m counting on you. Here are half the
box tickets. Do what you please with them.”</p>

<p>“I shall be there. Thank you.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Glenn Andrews</span> walked down the street,
which had been written on the sheet of paper in
his pocket.</p>

<p>“No. 23.” He looked up and saw that No. 23
was a hospital. There must be some mistake.
No, that was plainly what it said.</p>

<p>He stood looking at the door in an anxious
manner.</p>

<p>“Could she be here&#8212;ill?”</p>

<p>He had drawn a charming picture of her, a
radiant specimen of perfect health. His pulse
quickened. The curtains parted and a girl appeared
at the window. Her eyes were dim, her
face ghastly&#8212;the look on it was neither pain nor
age&#8212;it was a look of hopelessness. The rich,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
gleaming hair made a glory about her head, as
the light caught its golden sheen. That was like
her hair. A moment she stood there, looking
down the street, then dropped the curtain. He
saw her turn and go sorrowfully upstairs.</p>

<p>The light from the hall chandelier was very
brilliant&#8212;his face cleared. A better look satisfied
him it was not Esther Powel.</p>

<p>He pondered a minute, then started down the
street again. She had evidently given him the
wrong number.</p>

<p>At the corner he stopped a policeman. “I am
looking for a boarding house on this street&#8212;No.
23, West.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the next street; that same number
is a boarding house. All in this block are private
houses except the hospital.”</p>

<p>Glenn thanked him and went on quickly.
She’d made a mistake in the street maybe. It
would soon be too late to call. He did not need
to inquire again, for as he turned the corner he
could see Esther Powel on the steps, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
out upon the square ablaze with light and confusion.</p>

<p>“It is Mr. Glenn.” With the words she sprang
three steps at a time to the pavement. “How
glad I am!”</p>

<p>And then she stopped, remembered, and held
out her hands.</p>

<p>“How you frightened me. You had me going
to the hospital to find you. That’s the same
number on the next street.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you expect me to get things
right when I feel like I’m flying every way and
can’t get myself together to light?”</p>

<p>Glenn always found her startling figures amusing.
“You will feel that for awhile.” He hadn’t
taken his eyes away from her as she led the way
into the parlor. “You are stunned by the novelties.
You will also be quickened by them.”</p>

<p>Esther, full-breasted, slender-limbed, rounded.
The joy of life was upon her&#8212;the loveliness of
full bloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“It’s good to see you again,” he said, “but
why didn’t you let me help you get settled?”</p>

<p>“It took enough of your time to write that
discouraging letter.”</p>

<p>“You know I didn’t mean it for that. I
would do most anything to further your art. But
it is best to do only that for what we are intended.
Nobody could know that as well as yourself.
I believed your decision would be right, whatever
it was,” he told her. “Are you pleased with your
advancement so far?”</p>

<p>“Not pleased&#8212;buoyed. I hope to do something
some day.” As she raised her eyes to him
they expressed something of the wild, delicate,
throbbing pride. “I did not come to fail.”</p>

<p>“I believe that, from the good reports I have
heard through our old friend, your professor.”</p>

<p>“He was very nice to me; it was through him
that I knew about the Frenchman who will instruct
me here.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve arranged all that, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I begin my lessons next Monday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Smart girl. How are you situated here; are
you comfortable?”</p>

<p>“Comfortable!” she laughed. “I have to come
downstairs to draw a good breath. They stow
me away in a sort of a garret on the fourth floor.
As Cousin John would say, there isn’t room to
‘cuss’ a cat without turning sideways.”</p>

<p>“I believe your Southern men are more given
to profanity than Northerners,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but his is so whole-souled that it is only
‘profunity.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear; don’t think that I’m opposed to it,”
Glenn interrupted. “I sometimes find relief in a
good, wholesome&#8212;”</p>

<p>Esther held up a warning forefinger.</p>

<p>“Then you may do mine for me. I shall need
it if I stay here long enough.”</p>

<p>“Boarding house life is a miserable parody on
home, I know. But we can stand most anything
for a while if the incentive is great enough.”</p>

<p>“All these looking-glasses keep me tangled.
I seem to be going towards myself, from myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
beside myself, but I have been fortunate a part of
the time. Two young men on the train gave me
addresses of nice places to board when they
found that I was alone and a stranger to the
city.”</p>

<p>Instinctively Glenn frowned. “Have you got
them?”</p>

<p>“I saved them to show you.” Taking them
from her purse, she handed him the cards.</p>

<p>“You don’t want them,” he said, crushing the
cards in his hand.</p>

<p>“Did they ask permission to call?”</p>

<p>“One did. He wanted to come with me from
the station. I didn’t care to be bothered when
I was thinking of seeing you. My! how I
dreaded to see you, though I believe if I hadn’t
very soon I’d have started back South,” she said
in her effusive way. “I was afraid the change
I’d find in you would be disappointing.”</p>

<p>“Was it?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, because it is for the better. I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
want to care as I used to in the old days.” She
was still childish enough to be honest.</p>

<p>“Why, did you find me unworthy?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you were worthy enough, but I
have learned it is not well to let one’s affection
wrap their tendrils too close about another; it
hurts so when they are snapped.”</p>

<p>“There is no reason for them to be snapped,”
he argued. “The joy of clinging should make
them strong enough to wrap and unwrap, leaving
its sweet effect.” As he was leaving, “Trust
men for little and your instinct for a good deal,”
he said. His visit had made him all the more
determined. A profound passion can be displaced
only by one greater. He had had no experience
in guiding people, but he had a desperate
faith in his own way of reasoning.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Glenn Andrews</span> took Esther with him to the
concert. It was a great violinist’s last appearance
for the season.</p>

<p>She was happily excited, unconsciously holding
Glenn by the sleeve. The glitter and glory
of this wonderful, new world was dazzling. The
violinist, with his long hair and big face of
rugged strength, enchained her the moment the
music commenced.</p>

<p>With the intensity of her growing enthusiasm,
she gripped Glenn’s arm. He was repeatedly recalled.</p>

<p>“I expect one day to see you sway them like
that,” he whispered, as the curtain went down
for the fourth time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t! it is impossible,” she said, sighing.
“I am just beginning to feel that my teeth are
not strong enough.”</p>

<p>“There was a time when his were not, but he
wouldn’t let go,” Glenn said with emphasis.</p>

<p>Tears stood in her eyes. “Don’t do that, I
thought it would inspire you to see such result,
fulfillment; I believe it’s going to depress you.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I rejoice with him, I’m glad to see him win;
but three long years before you are sure of anything&#8212;even
failure&#8212;is hard to look forward to.”</p>

<p>“Did your teacher say it would take you that
long?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I had thought that I would double
it; take twice the lessons and practice. After
all, I may fail in the end.”</p>

<p>“Hush, you are no weakling. Of course it’s
work, it’s drudgery; that’s the bracing part of it.
You’ve earned the place when you do get it. An
effortless success is only a crueller word for failure;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
you must not be impatient. I used to have
to remind you of that.”</p>

<p>Glenn did not know how she would take this;
he had had alluring glimpses of her deeper self,
but he must understand her very thoroughly or
he could not hold her, charmed.</p>

<p>She did not make any reply.</p>

<p>He was gazing at a box near them and bowed
to a majestically handsome woman, splendidly
gowned. He touched Richmond Briarley’s arm.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Low and Stephen Kent. Kent is an awfully
decent chap. He is lucky to be a protegé of
hers. What a lot of good her indorsement has
been to him. I knew him on the other side. I
am writing the libretto for his new opera. You
were at the club Tuesday night when he was my
guest. Didn’t you meet him?”</p>

<p>“No, but I heard him play some of his own
compositions. Something was said about us both
joining the club. It’s too literary for me.”</p>

<p>“I am his voucher. He sails soon and I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
think he expects to come into the club until he
returns in the winter.”</p>

<p>Glenn turned to Esther, who was absorbed in
the last number on the programme.</p>

<p>She spoke softly to him. Gathering up her
white silk shawl, he folded it about her shoulders.</p>

<p>“We are going in a minute. The lady you see
with white hair in this box next to us is a leader
in artistic circles. I want her to know you.”</p>

<p>The curtain fell as they arose. Linking his little
finger in hers under the fringe, he led her
over to the box. There was something in his
manner that expressed beyond question his determination
that never while he had strength
should the world darken this child’s soul.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Glenn Andrews</span> was unwearied in his visits,
and held to an abiding faith in Esther’s future,
and stronger and stronger grew his determination
to be steadfastly loyal to her. He seemed
to have an exhaustless reserve fund of nerve
power. Stinted in sleep, as he was, and overwhelmed
by his own work, yet he made time to
look after her.</p>

<p>With an infinite patience he was cutting a
niche for himself, and above it a name.</p>

<p>His admirable solicitude for Esther was at
strange variance with his desire to wound her,
bruise her, make her think and feel.</p>

<p>To her he was a mystery unfathomable. The
heart within her was so delicate, it easily swayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
from harmony to discord. She was so sensitive,
she must needs be always responsible to the painful
as well as the ecstatic emotions.</p>

<p>In her habit of telling him everything that happened
in her life there was one thing that she
had kept. The nearer it came, the more vivid
grew her prescience of what awaited her. The
strain of this fresh anxiety was consuming her.
Would she have strength to hold out?</p>

<p>She was whiter, her cheeks had not quite that
rose bloom she had brought with her out of the
air and sunshine. Under this weight she went
steadfastly on, in silence.</p>

<p>Glenn saw this. He had told her she was
working too hard. He could see that her health
was not up to the mark. When there was a
cloud, or the shadow of a cloud upon her face,
he saw it. She should see a doctor. He told her
that repeatedly. Honest as she was, she could
not bring herself to tell him that she was too
poor. Already she had battled through the heat
of the long summer, in need of medical assistance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
She was living up to her income, and
found it difficult to furnish the bare necessities
and pay for just half the lessons she had counted
on. There was no hope of shortening the three
years except by increasing her practice. This
she determined to do, six hours a day instead of
three.</p>

<p>“I believe you would stay up in that room and
mold,” Glenn said one day as they walked in the
sun by the river. “You surely could find time for
an outing once a day for an hour or two.” He
was puzzled to know why she had declined to
walk with him of late. It did not occur to him
that lack of time was her excuse.</p>

<p>“You have your lessons but four days in the
week,” he said.</p>

<p>“Only two now,” she corrected him.</p>

<p>“Then you have changed your plans!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And how many hours a day do you devote
to your practicing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, several; it depends upon my humor and
strength.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you consider the strength,” he
said as he looked at her. “You are tired now,
why didn’t you tell me? Sit here and rest a little
before going back.”</p>

<p>As they took a seat on the high edge of the
river, there was something like a sob of exhaustion
in her breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, Esther! How could you?” seeing how
faint she was. Her cheek fell in one hand.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were tired?”</p>

<p>“The air was so bracing, I kept thinking I
would feel better directly. How stupid of me to
give out so quickly.”</p>

<p>His tender little cares for her comfort, in small
things, had often made her ashamed and afraid
she was a burden to him.</p>

<p>“Did the doctor give you a tonic when you saw
him?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been to him yet.”</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews looked away across the blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
water. His heart understood. He knew by her
face that the coldest thing on earth was clamping
at her heart. Presently he turned back to her.</p>

<p>“How good a friend do you count me?”</p>

<p>“The best I have in the world.”</p>

<p>“Good enough to ask anything of me&#8212;everything?”</p>

<p>She sat in silence, taking her hand softly away
from the support of her face.</p>

<p>“Will you answer me?”</p>

<p>“There are some things that I would ask of
nobody that lives.”</p>

<p>Glenn slightly raised his broad shoulders and
lowered them with a sigh.</p>

<p>“I am disappointed in our friendship. It has
failed.”</p>

<p>She reflected a moment; “I don’t deserve that
from you.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I deserve what you have just put upon
me.” It had struck him like a pang. The sweet
sense of her faith&#8212;her dependence upon him&#8212;had
been the very dearest emotion of his life. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
strengthened him, to feel that she might lean
hard upon him. He was not willing that the
pressure should be lessened.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to pass for more than I am
worth. If I have fallen short of what you expected
of me, I don’t blame you for putting me
down on the common level with everybody.”</p>

<p>If her sorrow had been his own he could not
have felt it more deeply. “Only I am disappointed,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>She was distressed to the soul; his sympathy
for her had been so courageously beautiful, so
exquisitely true, that she could not bear the idea
of disappointing him, or allowing him to feel that
she underrated his value.</p>

<p>“I don’t know men very well, but I know you
are not like the others. Nothing could be very
hard to bear, because you are my friend. I welcome
the days which bring you to me. You have
been my fortification.”</p>

<p>“Then prove it,” the soft answer came back.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
“I know that something distresses you. Tell me
of it, and let me help you.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing that you could change.”</p>

<p>“How do you know? Let me judge that.”</p>

<p>“No, not now, sometime I will tell you if you
can soften things for me.”</p>

<p>Her keen refinement would not let her talk to
him of her poverty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richmond Briarley</span> had never asked any
questions about Esther Powel; she was Glenn’s
friend, and that was all.</p>

<p>“I saw Miss Powel,” he said, as he and Glenn
sat over their lunch. “I nearly got past before
I recognized her. She has changed. She has
been ill?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” Glenn answered. “She’s
been working hard, and she hasn’t been used to
work. I am going away on my vacation to-morrow.
I’ve been wondering if there wasn’t some
nice place, just outside of town, where she might
go. She needs the rest, the change.” Glenn Andrews
made no secret of his kindly interest. He
and Richmond Briarley had long been closely
intimate.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with my yacht? The old

aboard, but let it sink. It would give you a
chance to show your heroism.”</p>

<p>“Would you come along?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I might not get ashore. Really I
have other plans, but it is easy enough to get a
crowd. There’s Mrs. Low and Kent.”</p>

<p>“Both on the other side, won’t be back before
winter.” Andrews looked worried as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Damn it, I couldn’t do it anyhow; I’ve promised
to go to the Adirondacks.”</p>

<p>Briarley glanced at him. “Another woman?”</p>

<p>“Several, Jack and his wife will be along.”
Even in the intimacy of their friendship Richmond
Briarley had never asked that much before.
Glenn Andrews alone knew how hard was
the sense of finding himself bound through overwhelming
conviction of duty.</p>

<p>“I was out to dinner with Jack last night. You
couldn’t look at him and doubt such a thing as
love, yet Marie was always a little tyrant. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
made me wonder, after all, what kind of a wife
made a man happiest.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you, a dead one.”</p>

<p>“Honestly I believe he would have gone stark
mad if he hadn’t won her. He worships her.”</p>

<p>“He’d have come out without a scratch. My
observation is that a man can get over not getting
a girl easier than he can get over getting
her.”</p>

<p>“I believe in marriage&#8212;it’s the only decent
way to live, but I wouldn’t care for my wife the
way he does; my regard wouldn’t have that self-sacrifice
in it. I’d want a woman to minister to
my comfort, put mustard plasters on me when I
was sick.”</p>

<p>“But the wife. What would she get in return?”</p>

<p>“My name, for the sake of which I would sacrifice
the most precious gift that could come into
a man’s life&#8212;a woman whom I could have loved
and by whom I could have been loved.”</p>

<p>“A pretty theory, but, ye gods! the practice.”
Briarley laid down his napkin and leaned back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
from the table, staring at the other contemplatively.</p>

<p>“Andrews, for a man of your logic, you are
confoundedly disappointing. I’d have thought
you’d have very fantastic ideals of marriage&#8212;of
the woman that was to make your home. You
claim that your philosophy is in straight lines.
There are two ways of making a straight line,
horizontal and perpendicular, then they cross.
You think it is infamous to marry for money,
and you have tabooed your pet hobby,” he said
with an ironical curl of the lip. “Five years ago,
before you had got your bearings, you might
have humored such a whimsical freak of that individuality
of yours, but now you would struggle
devilishly before you would spoil your life.”</p>

<p>“I have theories, not just to talk about, but to
live by. My philosophy is extraordinarily simple.
You can’t have the pie and eat it too.”</p>

<p>With a reflective survey of his friend, Briarley
commenced with a kind of confidential frankness.</p>

<p>“If you are to make marriage a commodity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
why not be brutally practical? You are a very
decent sort of a chap, and fame, for you, is on
the up grade. You could marry money. A poor
married man might as well be a street-car mule
and be done with it. Talk about it being easier
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
a rich man to go to heaven, why it’s easier for a
whole drove of them to get through than for man
to get anywhere without money.”</p>

<p>“You are very good to care anything about it,
but I have quite decided in my mind what I shall
do with that problem,” Glenn announced with
resolute calmness. The other lit a cigar, and
leaned back in comfort.</p>

<p>“I’ll swear you provoke me, and I don’t know
why I should give a hang. Self-will sometimes
degenerates&#8212;then it is stubbornness&#8212;but I
suppose every fellow has a right to sign his own
death warrant if he chooses, and failure is a death
warrant.”</p>

<p>“There are some things you know and some
that you don’t know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“And a devilish lot that nobody will ever
know,” said Briarley, as he flicked the ashes from
his cigar.</p>

<p>There was a tender spot in his iron heart for
Glenn Andrews. He was too noble, too talented,
to lose in sacrifice the possibilities of so brilliant
a future.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were strolling together in the art gallery.
It was the first time that Glenn had seen
Esther since returning from his vacation. He
stopped to admire a picture, for the second time,
pointing out its beauties for her. She appreciated
his interpretations, and her acute understanding
grew more beautiful to him.</p>

<p>“I never look at such work,” he said, “without
wondering what it cost its creator. The gift
of art is great, sacred, yet it is one long term of
self-denial.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” Esther assented. She was beginning
to realize its draining demands. She
had brightened a trifle to-day in spite of it. A
little of the old impulsive blooming beauty had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
come back. The brisk walk through the park, in
the keen, sweet autumn weather might have
heightened that&#8212;and Glenn’s return doubtless
had something to do with it.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Low has a picture in her gallery by this
same artist. She has one of the finest private
galleries in the city. You shall see it, I believe,
now that she’s back. I promised her I’d bring
you to one of her receptions. She’s noted for
having people who are amazingly clever, or beautiful
or something of the sort. Fortunately I
come under the class, ‘Should auld acquaintance
be forgot?’ But you are to do your turn. She expects
it. We will go next Tuesday to her opening
night. You will see a live lord. Her daughter,
who married one, brought him home with
her.”</p>

<p>“Will it make me like you any less?”</p>

<p>“I should hope not. Rather more, for he has
brutal manners, and you would never think she
held a higher place than his stenographer. But
she doesn’t mind that, she has a title. He draws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
his allowance from her and his inspiration from
elsewhere. I fancy they are rather contented.”</p>

<p>“Contented!” Esther lifted a solemn face to
him.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that a marriage without love
would crush all that was sweetest and finest in a
woman’s nature. Marriage for love is the dearest
gift to any soul&#8212;it is the highest ideal of
God’s world.” She was in one of her intense
moods.</p>

<p>“But if it be for anything else?” He encouraged
her to go on.</p>

<p>“It’s a desecration. Love is not only the
holiest thing in the life of a woman, but it’s life
itself for the man. It makes him whatever he
becomes. The righteous altar-vow is a delight
and to obey is the cry of the heart if it speaks the
words with the lips.”</p>

<p>“You know we never agreed upon that subject.
I consider marriage merely an incident
in life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“But the one decisive incident of it all,” she returned.</p>

<p>They had left the gallery and were going
through the park. His glance wandered often
from her face to a glad contemplation of the
vivid coloring of the woods.</p>

<p>“Mightn’t a man marry for honor?” finally he
asked.</p>

<p>“Give me an example.”</p>

<p>“I am not trying to convert you,” he said, disclaiming
all responsibility.</p>

<p>“Tell me of a case?”</p>

<p>His face contracted nervously. “Let’s talk
about something else.”</p>

<p>With a little impatient gesture, “Oh, give me
an instance, it will keep me from imagining
things.” She stopped by a rustic seat with
an independent lift of the head and would
go no further. She felt that she deserved
his confidence and trust. Upon her face were
tears of pained emotion. She did not know her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
real place in his life and whenever she struggled
for it her suffering was intense.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Glenn decided to humor
her. Taking a seat beside her, he began in his
tone of tranquil philosophy:</p>

<p>“Suppose a man&#8212;young&#8212;under an infatuation,
becomes engaged to a girl. When he is
older, his ideas change; he gets over it, she
doesn’t. Although he has a sincere regard and
respect for her, in his heart there is another ideal.
He regrets being bound. What should he do?”</p>

<p>“I hate the word ‘bound.’ Marriage is not to
bind, but to privilege. Without love it would
be nothing more than slavery. Every human
soul revolts at that.”</p>

<p>“But an engagement is like a gambling debt; it
has no witnesses. It puts a man upon his honor.”</p>

<p>“Might he not have the nobility to assume his
vows, without the fortitude to endure them manfully?
That would make each think nothing of
love and little of life. I believe it is impossible
for a man to be true to his wife with another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
woman’s image in his heart; in spite of outward
appearances the emptiness is there&#8212;convention
cannot crush out nature. If he took a vow like
that, he’d be false to it; hypocracy is dishonor.”
She suddenly fronted him.</p>

<p>“What would you do if you were the man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t make an example of me,” he said
in a hard voice. “You know me well enough
to guess what I would do.”</p>

<p>She turned her eyes to his face; her expression
changed. “You would be true to what you
thought was your honor.”</p>

<p>“I hope I would fulfill any promise I should
make.” He had always had himself in command,
yet he was sometimes conscious of a fear
that Esther might have dreamed some touch of
heroism in his nature, which was not there. Her
ideal of him had been impressed upon her immaturity.</p>

<p>“I have a story about a man’s honor,” she said
after an awkward silence, lifting a small paper
volume in her hand. “The young man on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
floor asked me to take it and read it. He said it
was ‘simply great.’”</p>

<p>“‘Simply great,’ was it?” Glenn said, taking
the book. “Certainly he is bold and unconventional
enough to presume to offer you a book
when you have scarcely a speaking acquaintance
with him.”</p>

<p>“He brought it to my door one rainy day; I
took it as a kindness.” Reading the French
title, Glenn’s eyes took on the glint of steel.</p>

<p>“Have you read it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, I thought we might begin it together to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t,” he told her, frankly. “It is
not the kind for you to read. When the young
man inquires for his book you can send him to
me.”</p>

<p>Glenn was never more savagely angry as he
doubled the book and thrust it into his pocket.
He would keep from her that part of the world’s
evil at least.</p>

<p>“Have I done anything you don’t like?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“No, but it maddens me to see anybody try to
impose upon you. Don’t accept any more courtesies
from that class; I’ll bring you all the books
that you want to read.”</p>

<p>“You are very good; I’ll try to remember that,”
she promised. He hoped she would. His care
of her was like the fond tending of a flower that
has been unwittingly left in a fetid atmosphere.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Low’s</span> receptions were more cordial
and less formal than the usual social affairs. Glenn
Andrews and Esther arrived late. The richest
Oriental splendor surrounded them. There were
a thousand rare souvenirs of foreign lands to
please the eye. The colors in the tapestries and
rugs were of that exquisitely tender hue that
comes only from age. The largest rug, covered
with inscriptions from Saadi, the Persian poet,
seemed to have caught more of the charm and
sentiment of the Orient. Glenn was calling Esther’s
attention to it while they waited for a
chance to speak to the hostess. Red lights
glowed warmly through the iron-fretted lanterns
swinging low. A hidden harpist was playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
soft, sweeping strains of sound. Mrs. Low
caught a glimpse of the late arrivals. She met
them with hands outstretched, a radiant smile
of welcome upon her face.</p>

<p>“Ah, Glenn, Miss Powel; charmed, I assure
you. Mr. Kent has been waiting to have this
young lady accompany him,” she said, as that
gentleman joined them.</p>

<p>“You came just in time, Miss Powel. Our
friend, Mr. Andrews, has told me that you have
been good enough to take the trouble to learn
the ‘Serenade’ that is to be in our new opera.
Mrs. Low has out-talked me and made me feel
that my friends should be first to pass judgment
before the critics get a chance.”</p>

<p>Esther hesitated a moment, smiling.</p>

<p>“That will be charming,” Glenn whispered to
her, inclining his head. He smiled slightly as his
eyes met hers.</p>

<p>His approval was what she had waited for&#8212;that
was plain. The next moment she had graciously
indicated her willingness by taking up her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
violin that Mrs. Low had sent for before she
came.</p>

<p>The sight of Stephen Kent at the piano and
Esther beside him made the rooms silent in an
instant and stilled the unseen harpist. Glenn Andrews
kept close watch upon the crowd as it
stood in mute attention. It was to note how she
was received. He had forgotten his share in the
honors. Stephen Kent sang the passionately
poetic words; the exquisite commingling of the
voice and violin suddenly awoke in the poet the
thought of what sincerity of the soul there was
in those words.</p>

<p>In the heat of the enthusiasm that followed
the encore some one grasped Glenn Andrews’
hands. “And those lines are perfectly exquisite.
I am wild to hear all of your libretto.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” he answered, staring, and that
moment it was the effort of his life to know what
she meant.</p>

<p>“Libretto?” he said to himself. “Oh, when I
heard such playing I forgot I had written anything,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
he declared, with a laugh. He was extremely
shocked to discover that he had composed
the words.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a little crazy?” the expression on
her face asked, as Mrs. Low came up and led
him away. She had become devotedly attached
to him during their life in Paris.</p>

<p>“If that is a fair sample of your opera, it will
be most enchanting.” The hearty words carried
with them something of the sincere interest
she felt.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Mrs. Low. Your approval
is a great compliment to our poor efforts. You, of
course, know its success means a better future
to both of us; the financial part of it being of no
slight importance.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to succeed; it has the merit and the
backing. Give yourself no anxiety. Kent certainly
has done his part well. It is his master
effort.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Low sank deep in the gorgeous cushions
and looked across to where Esther stood besieged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
She was so unspoiled and direct of manner.
There was something picturesquely Southern
in her simple gown.</p>

<p>“Tell me something more about her. Is she
in earnest or does she play with her art for the
same reason that a kitten plays with her ball?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is in dead earnest, Mrs. Low. She
is overworking in her enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>Glenn caught Esther’s eye as he spoke. There
was a touch of pathos in the smile.</p>

<p>“That will never do. You might persuade her
to take it more slowly.” She stopped a moment,
looking up with guarded eyes. Glenn Andrews
was not big print to her. The depths of his nature
had to be read between the lines. In her
heart she wondered if he would resent the questioning.</p>

<p>He studied her magnificent repose, that
matched his.</p>

<p>“She has genius. I have become quite interested
in her already,” said Mrs. Low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>A shade of relief passed over Glenn’s features
as he heard this.</p>

<p>“I have known her for years. The poor child
has neither parents nor friends to restrain or aid
her. She has not reached that point in her art
where she can earn a dollar. I have been thinking
many ways of trying to help her. It must
be some way by which she feels that she is earning
it. I know her so well.”</p>

<p>“It is not often that I ask such close questions,
but this time it is because of my interest.
What are you to her?”</p>

<p>Her tone did not imply idle curiosity. He
clasped his hands thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Honestly, I don’t know how to answer you.
I am her friend, brother, critic&#8212;I suppose. If
I had to select one word to express my relation
to her, I should say, chaperone.”</p>

<p>“Chaperone,” she repeated, with charming
grace. “That is a virgin field for a man’s possibilities,
but since I think of it, I had a great deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
rather trust some men I know to look after a
child of mine than most women.”</p>

<p>“Coming here alone, as Miss Powel did, and
with very little capital, it was hard for her to find
herself face to face with the world. But she has
determination. She actually steals hours from her
rest. She must have relief from the strain or it
will crush all the life out of her soul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; something must be done,” answering
his intensity with a sweet interest. “Couldn’t
I help you in some way?”</p>

<p>He reflected seriously a moment.</p>

<p>“I believe you could. Suppose you got her to
play here four times during the month and let
her believe you had rewarded her by paying her
twenty-five dollars each time. I would give you
my check for the hundred dollars each month.”</p>

<p>“That will be just the thing. Later she will
be able to get some good engagements at drawing
room recitals.”</p>

<p>“Would you indeed be willing to let me help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
her through you, Mrs. Low?” he asked, with
some confusion.</p>

<p>“I am only too happy to be able to add that
little to so loyal a project.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Your co-operation means more
to me than you can possibly imagine.”</p>

<p>“Your friend has been telling me of your work,
and how brave you are,” Mrs. Low said, as she
took Esther’s hand at parting. “I shall come
soon to see you. I think I can add a little sunshine
to your life.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Glenn</span> saw Esther a few days afterward and
found her unusually cheerful. Her face had a
new light, and she had good reason for it. She
spoke with a buoyancy of expression that Glenn
had not lately heard. She told how Mrs. Low
had arranged for her to play during the entire
winter at her receptions. This simplified the
complex future. She reflected a little more calmly
on her condition. All these months she had
tried to think of some way out of it. She had
thought of everything&#8212;except giving up.</p>

<p>She made friends. She was interested in
everything. In her appreciation and confiding
ways Mrs. Low found a degree of satisfaction and
intense pleasure in the reflected happiness from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Esther’s life. Glenn encouraged the tonic of
social life for her as something needful to everybody.
Under his own eye, he was willing to let
her glimpse at it in all its phases; the soullessness
of it, its petty intrigues and foibles. The flawlessness
of her own mind would itself be a shield.
Her contact with such frivolity would be like that
of satin and sandpaper. With intense interest
he watched her career during the season. He
was her severest and most unsparing critic, although
he sometimes believed that it hurt him
more than her. Their lives were moving along
together with unconscious accord. There was an
undercurrent of deeper sympathy lying dormant.
He was making her a part of his life. He would
have denied it, however, had any man put this
truth into words and accused him. A thousand
times he had told himself, reassuringly, that he
was commander still. He reasoned that her art
would soon be sufficiently lofty, sufficiently complete
for her to hear any decree that fate might
read to her. New friends, fresh scenes, homage to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
her art&#8212;all these would help to fill her life. This
was a conviction born of his own philosophy.
He fancied he could already perceive a more independent
air; a less frequent turning to him for
guidance and protection. This elusive, half-mysterious
charm she had acquired, he misinterpreted.
It was largely due to the different lights
that had been thrown upon him.</p>

<p>She had been repeatedly stunned by chance-heard
remarks of his betrothal. When Glenn
heard that Esther’s name was to figure prominently
in the most brilliant recitals of the season,
there was a buoyant sweetness in the frank radiance
of hope, the eager expectancy and passionate
faith in her ability. She had been tasting
some of the fruition of her toil. Of this he was
proud.</p>

<p>The night came. It was a fashionable throng
that poured into the Metropolitan. The fascinating
twirl of jewelled lorgnettes and the flashing
movement of the vast array of wealth and beauty
made the two wide, innocent eyes that peered out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
from behind the curtain, reel&#8212;drunk with the
wine of enthusiasm; this little atom who was to
win or lose before this great audience of connoisseurs.
Win she must. No girl could shake
off the memory of so public a humiliation. The
sight confused her. She trembled a little and
slipped back to her dressing-room. “I feel as
though the judgment day were at hand,” she
said. “My heart is bigger than my whole body.”</p>

<p>“You darling, it was always that.” Mrs. Low
gathered her proudly in her arms, as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” Esther left a warm
kiss on her throat. “Up to the very same thing
you were, looking for a particular face, I know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take another survey presently. Of course
he will be here. Oh! what a dream of a gown;
you look like a vision from heaven.” Mrs. Low
eyed her closely, fearful lest the misplacement of
the slightest detail might mar the perfect whole.</p>

<p>“This must be the laurel crowning of your season.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>Her delicate face was beaming; she felt it
rather than hoped it.</p>

<p>“This ordeal means everything to me. I am
not as frightened as I expected. Honestly, I feel
as if I could make music without strings or bow.
Something in the very air charges me with a
wild, savage inspiration. Go, look again, now.
I know he is here.”</p>

<p>Several minutes passed and she did not return,
so Esther went out to the wings while the first
numbers were being rendered.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear!” whispered Mrs. Low, as the
call came for Esther. “Do your best. Glenn is in
the right of the centre aisle, half-way back with
the woman in pink. I know you won’t disappoint
him.”</p>

<p>These words came from the gentlest heart in
the world, with no idea of their tragic significance.</p>

<p>Esther stepped to her place on the stage.</p>

<p>The bored faces of the leaders of the orchestra
brightened. Every instrument was ready to respond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
to the first notes of her obligato. Even in
that surging human sea she was conscious of
dumbly searching for Glenn Andrews. As she
stood slightly swaying with the first few strains,
she saw him&#8212;his head thrown back with a superb
gesture&#8212;his features all alight from
the ideal soul within&#8212;his dreamy, mystical
eyes full of expectancy. He was in
a state of rapturous anticipation. In the
“woman in pink” she recognized as being
the one with whom society had intimately
coupled his name.</p>

<p>What a heart-thrust! She blanched at the
thought of it. And of all the nights of her life,
this one&#8212;her very own&#8212;was most cruel.</p>

<p>There was a rush of resentment through her
being, stronger, for the instant, than everything.
She could not resist its influence; discord followed
discord until the orchestra was forced to
stop.</p>

<p>The scene before her whirled so fast that it
made her dizzy. She felt blindly across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
strings for a harmony which she had lost. Glenn
Andrews was conscious of a curious tightening
at the throat as he saw her pitiful struggles. His
heart almost stopped. She was failing. This was
maddening. He had had many disappointments
in his life, but this was one he could not face.
Abruptly he rose and rushed out into the aisle.
The humiliation was too bitter.</p>

<p>There was a little ripple of excitement. Esther
saw him going; but still did not realize that his
seat there had only been a coincidence. She
hated, she adored him. The moment seemed supreme
of all the moments of her life.</p>

<p>A feeling of longing unutterable came over
her&#8212;longing to recall him&#8212;a feeling that rose
to ever fuller power until her whole being vibrated
with the desire. She tightened her grasp
of the instrument to steady her convulsive trembling.
Glenn stopped. A new thrill was creeping
through the music. Her eyes evinced a conquering
fire born of internal despair. She was playing
now as if inspired by some power above and beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
all things of earth. Through it all ran the
shrill, sweet strains of her long-pent soul. Glenn
stood immovable, with his eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>The sublime passion throbbing through the
music was a sound that a human soul could not
resist, as if the player’s whole nature were speaking
to him. It pleaded, commanded, until it
smote each tense chord of his life&#8212;compelled
completest harmony. He followed with eager
looks every gesture of her bow. His lips broke
into a proud smile, revealing all he felt. It ended
in an echo, transcendent, sovereign, supreme.
The violin fell at her feet. The very air was
saturated with the incense of applause.</p>

<p>He awakened as though from a dream to share
in it. He grew almost hysterical as the audience
begged for an encore. The curtain rose. Esther,
flushed with her success, almost gasped as she
reappeared. There was a rain of flowers, falling
from everywhere. Glenn felt his heart beat after
her in an ecstasy of longing. The curtain rose
again and again. He had never known the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
height or depth of their natures before. He
adored her&#8212;Esther, whose growth in beauty,
power, glory he had watched with boyish tenderness.
All that he had admired, and had not
dared to hope for, were united in her. From the
depths of his being there came to him the first
over-mastering passion of his life&#8212;in a love that
he had forbidden himself.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>Glenn sent his congratulations with a lot of
flowers. He did not trust himself to call. That
was not indifference, but too much feeling. The
following week he sent her a few lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">“My dear Esther;</p>

<p>“It will be impossible for me to take you to the
musicale, but I have arranged to have Mr. Kent
call for you, and I feel sure that you will be in
good hands.”</p>
</div>

<p>This note of mild regret made her a little cross,
as it was the first time he had ever consented to
have her go out alone with another man. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
seemed nothing else to do but submit, wash a
tear of vexation from her face, and be ready to
go when Mr. Kent called.</p>

<p>From Glenn Andrews’ point of view this privilege
was an endorsement of the man he had selected.
She was his treasure and he could never
entrust it to any man in whom he had not the
staunchest faith. Later he learned through Stephen
Kent that they had gone together and the
affair had been as pleasant as usual. That was
satisfactory. He would have them go again together.</p>

<p>Ever since the concert Glenn had tried to think
only of his work. His calmness at such a crisis
at first led him into the belief that it would be
easy to hold himself in check. The revelation
that had come to him upon that night had been
the work of a strong thing but for a moment.
What he was now he would remain. How little
did he dream of what a sharp conflict he would
have in the strife to conquer himself.</p>

<p>He could not stay away too long&#8212;he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
upon it in a measure as his duty to see how the
infrequent visits were affecting her.</p>

<p>It was not until he was taking up his hat to
leave that he approached the subject of Stephen
Kent as her escort to the next musicale.</p>

<p>“He will be very glad to have you go with
him.” Glenn pressed her hand in his and he saw
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Esther!” He laid aside his hat, drew her
down beside him on the divan. He could not
leave until he had traced those tears to their
source. “What does this mean, tell me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ask me that!” She folded her
hands before her as if in mute emphasis.</p>

<p>He was not suspicious, but this made him
afraid&#8212;he felt as if something had struck him.</p>

<p>“Did Stephen Kent dare to hurt you. If so,
it’s my fault&#8212;I introduced you to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Glenn, let it go, but nothing would
induce me to go with him again.” She felt the
color go out of her face as she became conscious
of his fixed gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“Where has your frankness and freedom
gone?” He drew her toward him and compelled
her to meet his eyes.</p>

<p>His voice was full of power.</p>

<p>“You must tell me what Stephen Kent has
done.”</p>

<p>“You like him; I am afraid you will be angry,
disappointed.” She made no effort to free herself.</p>

<p>He could not draw a confession from her as
he sat some minutes waiting. “Have you that
little confidence in my friendship?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to make you feel that you have
not the friendship of that man.”</p>

<p>“Then you know that I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I know that he told me horrid, false things
of your life abroad, and tried to make me lean
upon him instead of you. He tried to persuade
me to do all the things and go to all the places
that you had warned me of. If I had known by
nothing else that would have made me know it
would be wrong&#8212;wickedly wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“Wolf!” He could scarcely hold his grasp for
the trembling of his hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll settle with Stephen Kent,” he said, aloud.
“He must answer to me for this.”</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews’ face looked manlier than ever
in its rage.</p>

<p>Esther’s heart stood still for a moment, then
beat wildly in its fear.</p>

<p>“Don’t risk yourself for me. I’m so sorry
I told you.”</p>

<p>“Now I shall take care of myself and of him
also. Don’t be fretting about the outcome. This
is the last time you need be annoyed with it.”
He stroked her hair, and there was a calming
tenderness in the way he did it.</p>

<p>She could have borne the indignity alone if
only Glenn had not brought the subject up. She
had never meant to tell it to anyone.</p>

<p>Glenn left the house and went at once, only
to find that Mr. Kent was not at home. Several
days in succession he called with the same result.
He wondered what impulse would lead him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
if he should meet him by chance. Delay could
scarcely weaken his determination to even up
this score.</p>

<p>When Glenn went to the regular meeting of
the club a few days later, it was a little shock of
surprise that the name of Stephen Kent was up
for membership. With a delicate tact he avoided
any part of the proceedings that was not forced
upon him. When it came his turn to cast his ballot
for the man of whom he could have said a
week ago he was all honor, he started, trembling
violently as he let fall from his hand&#8212;a black
ball.</p>

<p>The results of the ballot came as a great surprise
to every man of them except the one who
had turned the course. Questioning, no doubt,
went round the room and there was a ripple of
comment passing among the groups after the
meeting was over and the members were going
out. At the foot of the stairs one man met Stephen
Kent and told him the result, which he had
come over to learn. The disappointment in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
face was intense as he took a few steps more,
taking out his penknife to cut his cigar, and met
Glenn Andrews.</p>

<p>“Look here, Andrews, what does this mean?
They tell me I am blackballed.”</p>

<p>“They told you the truth,” he said, coolly.</p>

<p>“Well! that’s damned strange.” Kent’s answer
had in it the sting of humiliation.</p>

<p>“If I knew the man who did it, I would thrash
him within an inch of his life. The sneak!”</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews’ eyes were dilated and flashing.</p>

<p>“Stephen Kent, you don’t have to go very far
to find him. I am the man.”</p>

<p>“You; and may I ask why?”</p>

<p>“Because your dishonorable conduct to Miss
Powel proved to me that you are not a gentleman.”</p>

<p>He was fearless in speech and action. His
exultant manliness made the other cower.</p>

<p>“A man generally knows the lay of the land.
She is pretty free.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Free, my God!” Glenn Andrews’ face flashed
fire. “You are a liar!”</p>

<p>The next moment the two grappled. A crowd
gathered around in wild excitement. Before they
could be parted the battle had been fought. With
the first lift of his hand, Stephen Kent’s penknife
had slipped across and cut the radial artery
of Glenn Andrews’ wrist. Regardless of the flow
of blood, he had dealt the blow that laid the
other at his feet.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was several days before Glenn felt able to
resume his work. He kept away from Esther
until he could give himself a chance to recover
from the acute anaemia from which he suffered.
Finally, when he called, he found that she had
left that place, and her address could not be given
him.</p>

<p>He was worried and bitterly wounded.</p>

<p>This girl, wild of heart, full of all sorts of emotions,
full of unreasoning impulses who had once
been easy for him to understand, had gained a
complexity and subtlety new to him.</p>

<p>Yet he could do nothing now but treat it as a
recurrence of her old fits of childish petulance.
If, by some unaccountable chance, there was any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
finality in this step of hers, and her motive was
to break off their old blameless intimacy, he
would watch over her from afar. There was no
malice in his heart for her. Nobody could make
him believe a story, the truth of which would be
unworthy of her. Yet the dim, persistent sense
of dissatisfaction which he tried so hard to stifle,
under a rush of work and recreation, would not
vanish. Time, which he filled with the fever of
his literary passion, together with keeping in
touch with a few old friends, had become so
strained, so intense, that in spite of the firm
strength he had, the inordinate will, sheer physical
weariness conquered, the tense nerves for
a time relaxed.</p>

<p>It was in the latter part of April that Richmond
Briarley happened to stop in a flower store to
order a palm for some friend. At the counter
stood a slender girl. There was something very
unusual about her or he would not have given
her a moment’s thought, nor the second look.</p>

<p>Her hair swept back in deep waves from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
brow, under the wide, soft hat. The dark blue of
her eyes seemed to gently motion as she looked
at the delicate orchids the clerk held across to
her.</p>

<p>“That’s what I want.”</p>

<p>Then she turned away as he went to wrap them
for her. She felt a sudden swelling of the heart,
as she faced Richmond Briarley.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Miss Powel,” he said in
acknowledgment of her recognition.</p>

<p>“I have quite lost track of you since our friend
Andrews has been ill. You’ll be glad to know
his doctor now thinks he may pull through.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Glenn ill&#8212;dangerously ill?” She was
white to the lips.</p>

<p>The look on her face he would never forget
while he lived.</p>

<p>“Where? Where?” she said, eagerly clasping
her hands. “Let me go to him.”</p>

<p>“He has someone&#8212;you can do nothing. She
does everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>He said very little beyond the bare statement,
but his answer added to the pain of her wound.</p>

<p>There was nothing she could do. This was the
bitterest, cruelest thought&#8212;she was not needed&#8212;she
who would have died to spare him pain.</p>

<p>Richmond Briarley knew what it meant; his
heart was touched for her.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see him now, if you care to send
him a word.”</p>

<p>“Tell him how sorry I am, and would you take
these flowers to him&#8212;orchids are his favorite
flowers. I was going to wear them to a musicale
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I will take them.”</p>

<p>“Wait just a minute.”</p>

<p>She took the pencil of her chatelaine and wrote
her new address on the box; her fingers were
trembling, so she doubted if he would recognize
her signature.</p>

<p>She smiled a little as he lifted his hat, when
he bade her good-by. Pride was a matter of
principle with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>What she suffered in the days that came after
could not be told.</p>

<p>It was early in May before Glenn was able to
be out again.</p>

<p>To see Esther was one of his first visits. She
greeted him with a grave, solicitous face.</p>

<p>“I am glad you are better. I didn’t even know
it until you had passed the crisis.”</p>

<p>“Whose fault was it?” That old perversity
had not been subdued by suffering.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t; not to-day, anyhow.” She put her
hands up and gently turned down the collar of his
coat. “Come, now; lie down on the divan.
You’ve overdone your strength.”</p>

<p>His fingers in her folded grasp were trembling.</p>

<p>“I’m not equal to my work yet,” he said, as he
stretched out among the pillows, closing his eyes
wearily.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have come if it had not been your
birthday,” turning his head, revealing the painful
clearness of his profile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“I remembered you had someone who loved
you; to think of it always before&#8212;now there’s
nobody.”</p>

<p>Sitting beside him she stroked his forehead
very tenderly.</p>

<p>“You were always thoughtful of me.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a time.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I longed for the warm, sweet
touch of your hand on my head,” he said at last;
“it throbbed so, and ached.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, why didn’t you send for me?”</p>

<p>“You forget, I didn’t know where to send.”</p>

<p>She paled under the answer. “But you had
someone you wanted more.” She said this with
an impulsive touch of resentment.</p>

<p>“She was the best one I ever had. Professional
nurses are not always as solicitous or as
kind.”</p>

<p>“Professional,” Esther repeated to herself, betraying
no sign of the relief it gave her.</p>

<p>The soft wind moved the curtains and let a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
flash of sunlight in. Glenn looked out; the air
was full of spring.</p>

<p>He could not but think of the old days, the
paths upon which they had strolled now lay
green and solitary through field and woods.</p>

<p>For a man who loved to steep himself in the
sunshine and open air, he but seldom indulged
himself.</p>

<p>“Esther, get your hat; it’s too fine a day to be
indoors. I’ll take you away, out to Van Cortlandt
Park.”</p>

<p>“Are you able to stand the trip? Don’t go
just for my pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I shall enjoy it more than you will,” he said.
“It’s what I need. Haven’t I always told you
how selfish I was.”</p>

<p>Without another word she obeyed him, delighted
at the prospect. Van Cortlandt was beautiful.
They took a little boat and went out on
the lake. So precious was the silence&#8212;the solitude&#8212;the
shadow of the willows, that Glenn allowed
Esther to take the oars he had taught her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
to handle and stretched himself full length in the
boat. The water trembled under the sweet wind
that blew fresh upon him.</p>

<p>Esther was in one of her rapturous moods,
gazing with wide, dilated eyes upon the spring
woods opening out to screen the unresponsive
world&#8212;leaving them alone together. She could
see it all reviving him like wine.</p>

<p>“Esther?” The name and touch thrilled her.</p>

<p>“When they told me I might not get well, I
thought of you&#8212;I had something to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me now.”</p>

<p>“That was if I had to die.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t speak of your death!” Her voice
thrilled with a passion she herself did not understand.</p>

<p>“What I said as a child is still true. Life could
not be sweet to me with you out of it.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! With a great future flashing before
you.”</p>

<p>“Could any fortune be sweet, or any gift it
brought a woman be worth having, if the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
for whom she cared were not there to share it
with her?”</p>

<p>“A woman’s love is essentially spiritual in its
nature. It does not depend so much upon sight,”
he said.</p>

<p>She had dropped the oars. They were drifting
dreamily.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down below the horizon,
leaving purple shadows on its rim. The willows
sent their seductive motions across the face of
the waters.</p>

<p>She looked at him as though to draw him nearer
and enfold him in her stretched-out arms. The
warm impulses of her heart were warring in their
wild effort to be free. Silence was the language
of youth and love to him&#8212;they needed no words.</p>

<p>The force and the sweetness, the purity and
power of his nature as she interpreted it, was the
complete realization of her beautiful dreams.</p>

<p>“Have you ever forgiven me for spilling your
blood and leaving a scar?” Her thrillingly delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
touch on his knee swept him with a swift,
vigorous delight.</p>

<p>“Forgiven! I’ve blessed you. That is something
from you that I shall carry with me through
life. And there’s another I want&#8212;a memory.
You never have called me by my name.”</p>

<p>Looking into his fine, clear face, she felt the
love flowing softly like a fountain in her heart.
“Glenn,” she whispered his beloved name.</p>

<p>“Esther! dearest!” Drawing her toward him,
he kissed her on her lips as he held her close in
the clasp of his arms with the intensity of his
commanding love. Her hat had fallen off; he
caught the dank fragrance of her hair.</p>

<p>Something fluttered in her breast&#8212;something
new and strange and strong. She did not understand
that she had left girlhood behind and
become a woman. All the woman in her was
quickened by his kiss.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I love to feel your heart beating
against mine.”</p>

<p>Her words, her kiss, touched his soul to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
depths. He was startled at the depths he had
stirred.</p>

<p>“Heart! dear heart of mine!” She was in a fit
of adoring fury. Her lips met his, again and
again. She loved him so humanly and yet there
was only the tender throb and thrill of the sensitive
nature in all its refinement. Sweet emotions
shot through her breast.</p>

<p>“Love me, no matter what comes, Esther, love
me.”</p>

<p>He too felt some hurting power bound through
his blood, and wrestle with his reserve&#8212;his equilibrium.</p>

<p>His low voice, his soft eyes, held her; not a
tone, not a look but it caressed her.</p>

<p>The soft shadows, the limpid waters, the open
air&#8212;with it altogether he felt a strange softening.</p>

<p>“You never said sweet words straight from
your heart to me before.”</p>

<p>“Why words? Instinct, nature, tells us when a
thing is true. That great silent power often
stands between the soul and what it loves. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
too deep for speech. Did you ever drop a pebble
into a well to sound its depth? If it is shallow,
you hear it when it strikes the bottom. But
if you wait and never hear a sound, you know it
is very deep.”</p>

<p>Her sweet, low laugh rippled out over the
waters.</p>

<p>“Your laugh is like that of a child in a happy
dream. I hope it will always keep that sound.”</p>

<p>Straining her to him a moment, he then put
his hands to his face to shut out the dangerous
sweetness.</p>

<p>“Nobody but you will ever understand what
my nature is, because they have never so nearly
felt it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” he said, “the only difference is
that I know what is best for us and what is not.”</p>

<p>“To make music, one must have genuine feeling
for it; that is true of love. There has always
been a sympathy between us, but never before
so deep as now. The greater the love, you know,
the stronger the sympathy. Natures so well tempered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
so sympathetically adapted, very seldom
can endure; neither can afford to indulge in the
beauty of one he loves, for he may lose his own
seekings in sharing hers. Ideal love is not to be
satisfied.”</p>

<p>He said this with such an expression of grief
and sentiment that no one could doubt his belief
in his own philosophy.</p>

<p>This was life indeed. If he could only hold it
forever. He wanted to&#8212;he longed to&#8212;might
he not desecrate this beautiful soul, by intruding
his upon it for so short a time?</p>

<p>A sudden chill went through him. The horror
of their ideals being endangered made him draw
back. He had never entirely lost sight of the
delicacy and nobility of the relation. He was her
friend&#8212;her protector.</p>

<p>Slightly moving his position, he said:
“Esther, what is sweeter than comprehensive
sympathy? Each knows the other’s highest aims
and hopes, and each tries to help the other reach
and preserve those ideals. There is something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
beautiful, noble in the endeavor to sustain the
ideals of one we love, even though they should
not always succeed.”</p>

<p>“I believe that. The desire, the effort&#8212;shouldn’t
that go for something?”</p>

<p>“I think so, but will you always think it?”</p>

<p>“I hope I shall.”</p>

<p>As they anchored alongside the bank, Glenn
held out his hand to help her; her cheeks were
in bloom with life, and he was going home rested,
with all his senses and passions much keener and
many degrees finer in their possibilities.</p>

<p>“We have had a day of delicious happiness, we
should be thankful for that,” he said. “In a
whole life there are but a few days in which we
really live&#8212;we only exist most of the time,” lowering
his voice and looking into her sweet eyes.</p>

<p>“To be wholly happy is to forget the world
and one’s obligations to it.” There was almost a
caress in the way Glenn took out his handkerchief
and lightly brushed the drops of water from
her skirt. In putting the handkerchief back he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
touched the pretty trifle&#8212;a souvenir to recall her
twenty-first birthday. Twirling it between his
fingers he said:</p>

<p>“This is for you. Wear it for the sake of the
man who became a boy and learned what May
meant.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glenn</span> knew now that he had been mistaken.
The heart he had tended drew all its life still
from him. His knowledge of men and women
was great. He could not deceive himself. Nature
demanded a climax. He must advance or
retreat. He realized that he was coming to love
her too well&#8212;in a sweeter, nearer way. They
were to each other now more of a necessity than
an inspirational force. He must go away&#8212;it
was best: for their art, for their peace of mind.
It was some time before he could tell her this.
He could no longer trust himself to be tender
with her. He dared not risk himself; he was not
equal to it. It seemed to him their companionship
was never so beautiful as now when he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
about to break it. He was testing his strength
and asking his own soul if it were fit for the work
and the awful sacrifice. It was during a short interview
that he found courage to tell her how
his doctor had advised a change of scene and air.
A sea voyage, with perhaps a year abroad; possibly
Egypt&#8212;personally he hardly expected to
get beyond the old yellow city of his youthful
escapades&#8212;Paris, where the aromatic breath of
absinthe had tinged the air. There would be no
strain then. She knew what it meant. She knew
it was not for his health alone that he was putting
the sea between them.</p>

<p>“It may be just what you need to strengthen
you. In travel I fancy you will find oceans of
material for penwork and gulfs of inspiration.
And in Paris, that you have learned to love, you
might know real life and real joy.” The words
cost her an effort, but they were bravely said.</p>

<p>Richmond Briarley sat in his office alone that
night. He had just opened his safe and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
a package of legal documents drawn a paper
which he unfolded and read, a note secured by
mortgage, now past due. At the bottom it was
signed by the husband and wife. “Albert Winston
and Mildred Hughes Winston.” His lips
clamped, the circular wrinkles deepened round
his mouth. When he first knew Mildred Hughes
he was very young and poorer than he was
young. He had gone away and left her to this
man, who was well launched, expecting her to escape
the hardships of the poor. In time he would
forget her. He remembered how he had told
her so and left her&#8212;that day was more to him
than all the rest of his life. It was full of her.
“Forgetfulness!” He had never learned the
meaning of the word. With one swift survey of
the room, he slowly tore off the woman’s signature&#8212;this
was the last remnant of a life that had
been lived. As someone opened the door his
dream faded with the sound. The next minute
Glenn Andrews had come in, and was standing
behind him. He rose abruptly, closed the safe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
door, and hid the small paper in his hand. “Hello,
Andrews.” He held himself down to a semblance
of calm. “I thought it was about time
that you blew in. What are you doing with that
grip?”</p>

<p>“Taking it up to pack it,” he said, as he took
out cigars for both.</p>

<p>“Indeed! Are you really off? Are you romancing?”</p>

<p>“Most of my romancing is set to the same
notes&#8212;bank notes. It serves that purpose well
enough. I sail day after to-morrow,” he added,
carelessly.</p>

<p>“So you are going to kick over the traces, eh?
It’s lucky not to be tied so that you couldn’t
break away.”</p>

<p>“New York becomes more and more intolerable
every day, and I feel that I must get out of
it for awhile. I will still do some work on the
magazine, of course. Wait; give me a light.”
Andrews took the paper that Briarley had twisted
and touched it to the gas jet above his head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
It went out before it reached the cigar. With a
gesture of impatience he looked around and
found the matches.</p>

<p>They smoked on, talking together for some
time, Glenn toying with the paper in his hand,
carelessly rolling and unrolling it. He got a
glimpse of it, and said, quickly: “Look here,”
passing it over. “Is this of much importance?
Maybe you have burned the wrong thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! That’s nothing,” Briarley answered,
with an indifferent gesture. “Albert Winston,
the poor devil, is dead, and he died beaten. One
man has no business to take a mortgage on another’s
home, anyhow. I may be an unresponsive
brute, but I couldn’t turn a woman and
children into the street.” His throat was dry as
he turned his back and laid the scorched paper
over the flames. “We might as well finish it&#8212;let
the ashes settle it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that Winston died in
poverty?” Andrews asked, as he got up to leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“He hadn’t a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Let me see; whom did he marry?”</p>

<p>“Mildred Hughes,” Briarley hazarded, repeating
her name calmly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s so; I do remember her. Half the
fellows at college were daft about her. Winston’s
money won her, they thought.”</p>

<p>“Where are you off to, now?” asked Briarley.</p>

<p>Andrews turned. “I’ve got the ends of a million
threads to wind up before I start.”</p>

<p>“And some to break, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“Let me hear from you occasionally,” Glenn
said, as he grasped the other’s hand, and felt like
adding, “I have guessed your secret, Briarley,
my friend. Some men are heroes simply because
they didn’t marry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to come down to see you off. But if I
shouldn’t make it, remember to get all you can
out of life, my boy, and I wish you the best of
good luck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>Andrews looked worn, overworked. Richmond
Briarley had hoped that the returns from
the opera would take some of the strain off of the
ambitious fellow&#8212;but the unfortunate affair with
Stephen Kent had ended that hope.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> two weeks Esther had been at the seaside.
She had grown pale and tired from the
ceaseless round of work and social play. This
life had glamour, had charm, but no contentment.
Her pleasure in it was not real. She
entered it with the belief that it was sweet to
love, natural to trust. There was nothing in life
but faith and love. She was now in the midst of
people who talked with a sceptical contempt of
all that she had held sacred. They laughed at
her simple faith in the old-fashioned morality
taught her by cherished lips.</p>

<p>Glenn Andrews could not leave without seeing
her again. He had sent her a message. In
the afternoon of the last day he went down to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
seaside where she was stopping. The expression
on his face was one of unrelenting yet melancholy
determination. She was not in, so he
struck across the sand and strolled along the
beach until he found her. In spite of the pain in
her heart, her sensitive, proud face denied it.
There was a smile on her pale lips.</p>

<p>“You’re about as hard to reach as the bag of
gold at the rainbow’s end,” Glenn said, “but I am
glad to find that the other hunters have not
reached here. From stories that came back to
town, you don’t often escape all of your admirers
at once. I am fortunate to find you alone.”</p>

<p>“They are fairy stories that every girl has a
right to be a heroine of during the season.”</p>

<p>“I ventured to ask you to be so good as to
give me an hour, only because I am going away
so soon, and I may not see you again.”</p>

<p>“Your ‘so’ is femininely unsatisfactory. That
is the speech of a woman. How soon is that?”</p>

<p>He pointed across the water. “You see that
ship? Just about this time to-morrow, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
Majestic sails that way, you may know I am
aboard of her. I will wave you a farewell.”</p>

<p>Esther felt a tremor run over her. She looked
past him at the baffled surf, as, white with rage,
it sprang against the pier, retreating with a roar,
leaving a glimpse of the green sea stones beneath.</p>

<p>“So soon as that?” she said, her eyes opening
and closing convulsively. “I must have been
asleep; I didn’t realize that the time was so near.”</p>

<p>“Time is a mule; it always takes the opposite
gait from that which you want it to take. This
month has taken wings.” He gave a swift glance
at her. “And I expect the next one to crawl&#8212;that
is, after the voyage. I love the water.”</p>

<p>“As the doctor thinks the sea air so good for
you, why don’t you cruise along the shores of
France?”</p>

<p>“I may,” hesitatingly he answered; a sense of
guilt came over him at the thought of his deception.</p>

<p>“How long do you expect to be gone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said, absently; he knew this
was not curiosity, but personal concern; “it may
be three months, or three years.”</p>

<p>“Which do you expect it to be?”</p>

<p>“I do not expect, because to do that is to rob
one’s self of the emotion of surprise, without
which there is little pleasure in living.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I could be surprised any more.
I know how little there is ahead. I have been arranging
it all in my mind.”</p>

<p>He looked seaward. “How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Low goes home with her daughter.”
Here she touched her hands together impulsively.</p>

<p>“You both are going; that leaves me alone.”</p>

<p>“If thoughts count for anything, you will never
be alone.”</p>

<p>“How am I to know that?”</p>

<p>“You have the word of Glenn Andrews,” he
said quickly; “besides you have a glorious future
to look forward to. You have attained!
What happiness is there like unto it? Among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
many desires of my heart, the first is of your
happiness, which I believe lies through your art.
I am proud for you. Let me have one comfort
before we part. Promise me that you will not
disappoint me in my hopes for you. Your success
has come high.”</p>

<p>“Well, your future, tell me of that and what
your art has cost you.”</p>

<p>“What I have suffered is too late to discuss.
One can rate truly only as far as one has gone.
I cannot see as far ahead for myself as for my
friends.”</p>

<p>“I can see for you.” She spoke slowly, and
with difficulty. “Not only perfect health, but
laurels. I hope my little spot in your heart may
not be entirely shadowed by the lustre of that
hour.” Her composure was returning. “I shall
miss you; I want you to know that I appreciate
the value of your friendship, of which I stood in
need. You have helped me by your fond belief
in me.”</p>

<p>He didn’t raise his head, but his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I have done so little; don’t shame me.
You have been taking care of me instead. You
have made my life richer&#8212;deeper&#8212;brought back
some of the old faith in my own ideals that was
gradually being crushed out. I can understand
how men can be forced to such a height that falling
would seem too far and hard. I wish I could
feel that I had brought half the sunlight into your
life as you have into mine.”</p>

<p>“You have brought the most that will ever be
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that just as I am going; that
kind of sun shines not only through the senses,
but through the soul. It will always shine if you
will only think so.”</p>

<p>She bowed her head, the wide fringe of brown
seaweed trembled under the waves that ran up
on the warm-hued sand.</p>

<p>“And I am glad that we have had this year.
With all its pain&#8212;it is ours. Think of me sometimes
when I am gone, Esther. Be good&#8212;by
that I mean, brave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>His voice broke.</p>

<p>The tense strain of the moment was ended, as
he bent forward. His heart was in the kiss he
left on her hair. He turned and walked quickly
away without looking back.</p>

<p>In the darkness of her room, a young figure
lay stricken with grief across her bed, mourning
the vision of her ideals that seemed gone without
fulfillment. In the morning when she heard
the happy sound of laughing voices the hopelessness
of her bereavement came over her afresh.
She was alone in her sorrow and memories. She
was so weak that her body felt bruised, and her
arms lay like a dead weight at her side. Was her
courage broken? She prayed a passionate prayer
for the poor, heartless women who had kept faith
with virtue, and had not been rewarded&#8212;who had
scattered their broken ideals along the road that
they went, that all who followed must bleed and
suffer. She reached out for her violin; for a
while she lay still with it in her arms. It was not
sufficient. She needed some human thing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
companionship. Her soul hated its bodily enthrallment&#8212;she
would fly out of it&#8212;she must.
With a supreme effort she raised herself, and
faced the mirror. Her wide, dim eyes looked out
at her in pity. Then from her window she saw
a steamer going out. It was time for the Majestic
that was to take Glenn Andrews out of New
York&#8212;out of her life. The two loves of her life&#8212;they
must die together. Suddenly grasping
the neck of her violin, she struck it against the
side of the bed and shattered the exquisite thing.
She fell back prostrate, and there for weeks she
lay between this life and the eternal.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Glenn Andrews</span> went to France, to Moret-sur-Loing,
an old cathedral town, thinly peopled,
on the skirts of the forest of Fontainbleu. It was
secluded and out of the way. Here he would lead
a quiet life of study and work. This was his delight.
A poet-soul living in the pursuit, not possession
of the ideal. He had taken up his abode
in a little, old inn. Away from the world and yet
so near it. This was a beautiful country; the
sight of it did his spirit good. He loved the hills
and valleys and streams. On one side the ruins
of an old Keep belting him, and on the other, the
mills with long rows of deep windows, from
which the workers looked out upon the sunshine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
and their homes. The small mill-houses nestled
low in the leaves.</p>

<p>One day, returning late from a long walk,
Glenn passed a peasant mother, poorly clothed,
seated in her doorway; her child was sitting by
with its hands about its knees. She kept pointing
to the path that led to the mill. She was evidently
looking for some one. Soon a man came
in sight. A glow lit in the sombre eyes of the
mother, and a smile leaped from her haggard face
to the weary man, who suddenly straightened his
drooping shoulders. There was something besides
pain and work in the world, and they had
found it. He took the child in his arms, tossing
it up and letting it fall back again&#8212;this human
miniature of their love and youth. Many a day,
Glenn strolled at evening to see their meeting
when the father came home from the mill. It
rested him. He became absorbed in his work,
reading the proof of the third book that was to
add something to, or take from, the name of the
lyrical poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>It was not long until he heard of Esther’s illness.
It gave him a stab of remorse and distressed
him sorely. Had he, who had nurtured
her soul so carefully, injured it more deeply than
the careless world? He who had enthralled her
childhood, steadfastly guided her girlhood&#8212;in
whose woman’s destiny he had played so fatal
a part. Here the pathos and the irony were
strangely interwoven. Would it have been better
had she never known the broader, fuller world?
Had she now been living away her life contentedly
in the dark? These questions came between
him and his work. As he gazed dreamily out, the
leaves were swaying carelessly. A vision of the
dependent, lovely girl overwhelmed him. In the
wind he seemed to hear Esther’s voice&#8212;all the
youth and laughter gone out of it. It was not
like that day when he held her face between his
hands and gave her the kiss of love. He sighed
for the virginal softness of her tremulous lips.
The wind went wandering along the wood’s green
edge, like a miserable thing, offering no consolation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
From his meditation came like an accusing
ghost the realization that there is but one true
aim in life&#8212;to seek and find the soul’s complement.
He had sought. He had found, but he
had sacrificed. The spiritual need of his soul
had been set aside. For what? An agony of
yearning welled up in his heart&#8212;a yearning for
the sense of her sweet presence which thrilled
him with a joy of pain. The best of love they had
missed&#8212;the supreme surrender.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Esther’s</span> health was returning, and with it her
strength. Her pride and her spirit, both, were fired.
There was one thing left to her in her grief&#8212;concealment.
She bound this thought to her heart,
and held it close&#8212;so close. She was a soldier’s
daughter, and came of a stock whose fortitude in
defeat had been even more splendid than their
valor in war. To her the secret of love had been
harshly told, but she would hear it with courage.
In the swiftest current of destiny, she would show
her womanly strength.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">You</span> will wonder at seeing this letter from
me,” Glenn wrote to Esther, “for it will not be
a usual one&#8212;not at all the sort of letter you have
been accustomed to receiving from me. Perhaps
it is that I have changed&#8212;greatly changed
from that old self you knew&#8212;most of all changed
from what I used to be to you. I can see you
now as you looked to me that afternoon at Indian
Well, when I first spoke to you. You
touched me so closely then&#8212;so nearly&#8212;and you
were such a child.</p>

<p>“All through that first year I think you could
never have guessed how much the blossoming of
that little wild heart of yours meant to me. I
watched it from day to day, from month to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
month, so closely. Maybe I watered it some,
and pulled some of the weeds that might have
crowded its roots. I hope so. You were a child
then and I a man, yet I had been a man without
a passion. I thought much in those days, and
dreamed that I knew myself. Achievement was
my god. I told myself that my interest in you
was the interest of the philosopher&#8212;the master&#8212;and
I watched your mind unfold with a curious
delight. I know now, dear, that it was a far
different feeling from that&#8212;one that went far
deeper and meant much more to me, even when
I would not admit it to myself. It is to his own
heart last of all that a man admits his own error.
And yet, as I look back at it now, I think that
I meant to be honest with myself. When you
came to the city and I saw the wondrous woman
that had grown&#8212;when I saw your flower heart&#8212;still
the heart of the child in all that was sweet
and innocent&#8212;turning more and more towards
me for its sun&#8212;it waked something new within
me. I saw the problem. I felt your dependence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
grow each day stronger. You leaned upon me
so that I thought sometimes I could feel every
throb of your heart. You were achieving. Your
art was growing. Your genius was lifting. You
were coming nearer and nearer to the ideal that
I had imagined for you. When such a development
has become the great and absorbing passion
of a man’s life, I cannot express to you how
haunting becomes the fear of disappointment,
how terrible the jealousy of circumstance that
may step between him and its fulfillment. You
had beautiful ideals&#8212;such as I have had&#8212;and
they had grown a part of you. To lose them
would have ashed the ember; it would have deadened
the quick sensibilities and wounded that
soul-instinct of yours in which your music lived.
And when I saw these ideals dependent upon me&#8212;upon
my presence&#8212;upon the sympathy of
mine, which I could not have denied if I had
tried&#8212;I stood by them and you. Dear, the soul
of a woman is a wonderful thing. It will not
bear experiment. Yours was like a sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
plant that cannot bear the light, and sheds its
loveliest perfume in the dark. So I tried to give
it the darkness&#8212;to cloud the glare of hollowness
that was in our world&#8212;to let the light in slowly
and only when the leaves were strong enough
to bear it. All this time I could not help but
see that when I went from you the shock would
be great. My philosophy taught me the penalty
of emotion, and I thought I had much to do in
the world. I dreamed of work that would absorb
me utterly&#8212;that would take the best that was in
me, of feeling and of effort. All my life I had
denied myself the passion that my eyes told me
was growing in you. I had grown to consider
myself apart from others&#8212;a mental solitary who
had locked the door of his heart because he had
work to do. It had not occurred to me that the
Juggernaut whose rumbling wheels I would not
hear might crush you. It was the concert at the
Metropolitan that opened my eyes. I knew then
that your art and your heart had twined together
so intimately that if one were cut, the other would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
bleed. I knew then that I must either go or
stay, that if I became a stronger part of you my
going would be fatal to your own achievement
and to mine. Dear, it was not all selfishness&#8212;this
resolve of mine. You will never know what
it meant to me to tear up the roots that had
grown in spite of me: it was like tearing the
flesh and leaving it quivering. But that I could
have borne if it left you better able to go on. I
did not know then what I know now. I blame
myself that I did not read truer. The news of
your breakdown and the giving up of your music
came to me like a blow in the dark. In showing
me yours, it has shown me my own heart.
The depths of my self-condemnation have
taught me myself. It has taught me that achievement
is a pitiful thing compared with a woman’s
love&#8212;that your happiness means more to me&#8212;a
thousand times more&#8212;than success: that I love
you&#8212;I love you&#8212;utterly and wholly&#8212;and that
I want you to be my wife. The future is impossible
to me without you. Each day since I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
you, your step has been in every sound. Each
night your face has been my vision. Here from
my window I can see a little knoll on which is
a cross, where the peasants go to pray to the
patron saint of the village. It is ugly, and battered,
and old, but it has come to be beautiful to
me, for I know now what they are praying for.
The hills are gold with the grain, and a little
winding path runs down toward my eyrie. I can
almost imagine you coming down it now to meet
me, with your dear face raised to my window&#8212;”</p>

<p>As Glenn finished the page, the boy tapped at
the little door with the daily mail, and he reached
out an indifferent hand to take it. A familiar
flourish caught his eye, and, recognizing Richmond
Briarley’s penmanship, he opened a bulky
envelope. A card, closely written, and a small
book met his gaze.</p>

which she earned about her own price. She has
come to the philosophical conclusion that you
used to uphold: which is, that as long as a person
<i>does</i>, it don’t much matter what a person <i>feels</i>.
Anyway, she is doing it; and I take it from this
novel that she is not feeling much either.</p>

<p>Glenn read the letter with a curious shock, and
opened the novelette. As he finished the last
page and laid it down on the table beside him&#8212;this
story with the heart of a stone&#8212;he sat looking
out the window with a daze of anguish in his
eyes. His hands were supporting his bearded
chin. Without, the splendid sunset, the gilding
flame of which caused his features to shine resplendently.
His sad, wistful face, convulsed
with emotion. What a tumult of silent, unspeakable
memories; what feelings of regret and longing!
Instinct does not always point the truth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
No suspicion of the brave ruse of Esther came to
him now&#8212;no apprehension of the hurt pride
whose strain of revolt forced from her this literary
lie. He had been driven blindly on by his
yearning for the more perfect art. He didn’t care
for laurels now, nor for that art for whose sake
he had destroyed the best thing in his life. Was
ever heart-break more cruel? He sat for an hour
in silence. The sunset had lost its beauty. The
grain on the hills had lost its gold. He took the
letter he had been writing to Esther, tore it up,
and flung the fragments of what, if he had known,
was the best of his life, out the window. A lazy
breeze caught them up and scattered them. A
single one with the word “love” on it was blown
back and settled slowly in his hat. A bell was
ringing for compline. He saw the peasants in
their simple devotion going slowly to worship.
He took his hat and walked across the street to
the little café. There two comrades called him
over to have a bottle of wine with them.</p>

<p>“Ah, poet!” one said, laughing as he reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
over and took the stray bit of paper that lay on
his hair. “Still the philosopher! Making love
with your head?”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, this time, it was from the
heart,” and Glenn Andrews forced the shadow of
a smile into his lips.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
